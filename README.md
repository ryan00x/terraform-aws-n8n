# terraform-aws-n8n

Terraform module for deploying [n8n](https://n8n.io) on AWS.

Deploys the production-grade multi-main setup: multiple n8n main instances, dedicated worker pods, external PostgreSQL (RDS), Redis (ElastiCache), and S3 for shared file storage. An **n8n Enterprise license is required**.

The module expects a pre-existing VPC. If your parent domain is hosted in Route 53, pass `route53_zone_id` and the module issues the ACM certificate and creates the DNS alias record itself. A single `terraform apply` brings up n8n end to end with no manual DNS steps. If your DNS is elsewhere, pass a pre-validated `certificate_arn` instead.

> The `terraform-aws-n8n` module is in pre-release. Expect breaking changes at any time before the first stable release.

## Architecture

![n8n on AWS architecture: users and webhook apps reach an Application Load Balancer that fronts an EKS cluster running separate main, webhook-processor, and worker pods, with RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, and S3 as managed backing services](docs/images/architecture.png)

Users and inbound webhooks hit an Application Load Balancer (managed by the AWS Load Balancer Controller) that fronts the EKS cluster. Inside the cluster the n8n Helm chart runs three separate deployments: main instance pods (leader election, UI/editor, REST API), webhook processor pods for inbound triggers, and worker pods that run job executions and scale on Redis queue depth via KEDA. State lives in managed services outside the cluster: RDS PostgreSQL for workflow state, ElastiCache Redis for leader election and the worker queue, and S3 for binary data. ACM issues the TLS certificate for the ALB. The cluster
also ships the EBS CSI driver and a default encrypted `gp3` StorageClass, so
PersistentVolumeClaims from workloads deployed beside n8n bind out of the box
(n8n itself needs no volumes).

AWS permissions for pods (the Load Balancer Controller, Cluster Autoscaler, EBS CSI driver, and n8n's own S3 access) are granted entirely through EKS Pod Identity, not IRSA. See [docs/pod-identity.md](docs/pod-identity.md) for the associations this module creates and how to extend the pattern for your own workloads.

In this multi-main topology, `n8n_license_detach_floating_on_shutdown`
defaults to `false`, overriding n8n's own upstream default, so a rolling
restart of the main pods cannot crash-loop the fleet by zeroing the shared
floating license cert. See
[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md#multi-main-crash-loops-after-a-rolling-restart-helm-stuck-in-pending-rollback)
for the failure mode this avoids and how to recover if you hit it anyway.

## Prerequisites

### General

- An **n8n Enterprise license key** (`n8n_license_key`): the module does not provision a community-edition deployment.
- **Terraform CLI `>= 1.9`**, with the `aws`, `kubernetes`, and `helm` providers configured by the caller. The module declares `required_providers` but does not configure them (see [`examples/small/providers.tf`](./examples/small/providers.tf)).
- Read [Stability & versioning](#stability--versioning) before pinning a module version, and [Compatibility](#compatibility) for the provider/chart majors this module ships against.

### Networking

- A **pre-existing VPC** (`vpc_id`), its `vpc_cidr_block`, and public + private subnet IDs (`public_subnets`, `private_subnets`) tagged for EKS/ALB. VPC creation is intentionally out of scope (see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope)). The examples provision one via `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` if you need a reference.

### DNS & TLS

Set exactly one of:

- `route53_zone_id`: the module issues and validates the ACM certificate and, when `create_ingress = true`, manages the Route 53 alias. With caller-owned ingress, the caller also owns its DNS record.
- `certificate_arn`: a pre-validated certificate for any other DNS provider. See [`examples/cloudflare/`](./examples/cloudflare/) and [`examples/godaddy/`](./examples/godaddy/) for the pattern of issuing the cert outside the module and passing the ARN in.

### Secrets

- `n8n_license_key`: pass as a Terraform variable (e.g. from a secrets manager or `TF_VAR_n8n_license_key`), never hardcoded in `.tfvars` committed to version control.
- The module generates `n8n_encryption_key` and (when `create_database = true`) the RDS `db_password`, and returns both as sensitive outputs. **Back these up immediately after the first apply**: there is no re-issue path, and losing the encryption key makes existing credentials/workflow secrets unrecoverable. See [Out of scope](#out-of-scope).

### Compute

- Pick a starting node size and count from the [Examples](#examples) table (`small`, `medium`, or `large`), then tune `node_instance_type`, `node_min`, and `node_max` from there. `node_min` is a steady-state floor you pay for 24/7; `node_max` is a hard ceiling enforced by the Cluster Autoscaler.

### Logging & metrics (optional)

- `n8n_metrics_enabled` exposes a Prometheus-scrapeable endpoint (see [Prometheus metrics](#prometheus-metrics)). The module does not bundle Prometheus, Grafana, or a log shipper; see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope).
- Enterprise [log streaming](#log-streaming-enterprise) is available separately from the metrics endpoint.

## Usage

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  source  = "n8n-io/n8n/aws"
  version = "~> 0.2.0"

  aws_region      = "us-east-1"
  cluster_name    = "n8n-cluster"
  n8n_domain      = "n8n.example.com"
  n8n_license_key = var.n8n_license_key

  # Pre-existing VPC — bring your own.
  vpc_id          = module.vpc.vpc_id
  private_subnets = module.vpc.private_subnets
  public_subnets  = module.vpc.public_subnets
  vpc_cidr_block  = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block

  # EKS node group autoscaling bounds (defaults shown). Driven by Cluster
  # Autoscaler — see note below; you pay for `node_min` nodes 24/7.
  node_min = 3
  node_max = 6

  # DNS — set exactly one:
  # 1. Parent domain in Route53 → module handles ACM + alias record.
  route53_zone_id = "Z0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ"
  # 2. DNS elsewhere → bring your own pre-validated cert.
  # certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate_validation.n8n.certificate_arn
}
```

The module declares `required_providers` but does **not** configure them. Callers must configure `aws`, `kubernetes`, and `helm` providers. `kubernetes` and `helm` are configured against the cluster this module creates — see [`examples/small/providers.tf`](./examples/small/providers.tf) for the standard wiring.

`node_min` and `node_max` are the EKS node group's autoscaling bounds. `node_min` is your steady-state floor — you pay for those nodes 24/7 even when idle. `node_max` is a hard ceiling: if peak workload needs more nodes than allowed, pods stay `Pending`. Defaults fit the `small` example only; see the Examples table for production sizing.

For a full end-to-end example including the VPC, see [`examples/small/`](./examples/small/) (Route 53), [`examples/cloudflare/`](./examples/cloudflare/), or [`examples/godaddy/`](./examples/godaddy/). If `terraform apply` fails on a `helm_release` (most often due to a Helm 4 cache layout issue or a webhook race on first install), see [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](./docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Support

This module is open source software, maintained by the n8n Solutions team independently of n8n's enterprise products. While the n8n Support team provides dedicated support for the enterprise offerings, this module isn't included.

**Bug reports and feature requests:** open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/n8n-io/terraform-aws-n8n/issues). We triage on a best-effort basis; there is no SLA.

**Security issues:** see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the disclosure process. **Do not** open public issues for security findings.

**General n8n questions** (not specific to this module): use the [n8n community forum](https://community.n8n.io/).

## Stability & versioning

This module is pre-1.0. We use minor versions (0.1, 0.2, …) as the
breaking-change boundary and patches (0.1.0, 0.1.1, …) for additive or
bug-fix changes.

| Across | What may change |
| ------ | --------------- |
| `0.MINOR.PATCH` → `0.MINOR.PATCH+1` | Bug fixes, new optional inputs, new outputs, new resources whose absence wouldn't affect existing callers. No removed or renamed inputs/outputs. No changed defaults that move infra. No changed resource addresses. |
| `0.MINOR` → `0.MINOR+1` | Anything else, including removed inputs, renamed inputs, default changes that force resource replacement, refactored resource addresses, and bumped provider version floors. Each such change is called out in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) with an upgrade note. |

Pin with `version = "~> 0.2.0"` to auto-receive 0.2.x patches without
accidentally crossing a 0.2 → 0.3 boundary. Note the three-component
constraint: `~> 0.2.0` resolves to `>= 0.2.0, < 0.3.0`, whereas the
two-component `~> 0.2` would resolve to `>= 0.2, < 1.0` and let you cross
minor boundaries unintentionally. To upgrade across minor lines, retype
the constraint (e.g. `version = "~> 0.3.0"`) and read the release notes.

This contract goes away at 1.0.0 in favor of standard SemVer.

### Compatibility

This module ships against specific provider majors. Notably:

- **AWS provider:** `~> 6.0`. Upgrading from a v0.1.x deployment (which
  pinned `aws ~> 5.0`) requires a one-time `terraform plan -refresh-only`
  followed by `terraform apply -refresh-only` to settle AWS provider 6.0's
  per-resource `region` attribute into state before applying other changes.
  Callers who must stay on AWS provider 5.x should pin this module to `~> 0.1.0`.
- **Helm provider:** `~> 3.0`. The 3.x release is a Plugin Framework
  rewrite; `helm_release` drift detection is stricter, so the first
  `terraform plan` after upgrading from v0.1.x may show in-place diffs on
  existing releases. Callers who must stay on Helm provider 2.x should pin
  this module to `~> 0.1.0`.
- **Kubernetes provider:** `~> 2.0`.
- **Terraform CLI:** `>= 1.9`.
- **n8n Helm chart:** default `1.10.0`. Other chart versions can be
  selected via `n8n_chart_version`.
- **n8n application image:** defaults to the chart's `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` repository on the floating `stable` tag; production deployments should pin a  specific version via `n8n_image_tag` (e.g. `"1.2.3"`) to avoid crossing major-version boundaries on an unplanned pod reschedule. `n8n_image_repository` points the release at a custom image (see [Custom n8n images](#custom-n8n-images)).
- **EKS:** validated on Kubernetes `1.35`.
- **PostgreSQL:** validated on RDS `18.4`.

See [docs/upgrading-n8n.md](docs/upgrading-n8n.md) for the procedure to safely bump `n8n_chart_version`/`n8n_image_tag` on an existing deployment, and [docs/helm-chart-coverage.md](docs/helm-chart-coverage.md) for which n8n Helm chart values this module exposes versus leaves untouched.

## Out of scope

v0.2.0 intentionally does not cover the following. Each item is
documented here so that issues filed against them can be triaged
quickly; several are candidates for future minor releases (see
[`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md)).

- **VPC creation.** The module requires a pre-existing VPC with both
  public and private subnets tagged for EKS/ALB. The examples
  provision one with `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`, but that VPC is
  *not* managed by this module. Rationale: VPCs are
  organization-shaped, not service-shaped.

- **Multi-region / cross-region deployments.** One module instance =
  one region = one EKS cluster = one n8n deployment. Cross-region
  replication of the database or S3 binary storage is the caller's
  problem. Rationale: pre-1.0 surface area; AWS provider 6.x's
  per-resource `region` argument is the natural foundation for this
  in a future minor.

- **GovCloud, AWS China, and Outposts.** The module uses generic AWS
  APIs that *probably* work in these partitions, but it has not been
  validated. Endpoint differences (e.g. EKS Pod Identity GA dates per
  region) may break things.

- **Air-gapped deployments.** `n8n_image_repository` moves the n8n
  application image to a registry you control, but everything else
  still comes from public registries: the n8n chart itself from
  `ghcr.io/n8n-io`, the task runner sidecar image, and the KEDA /
  Cluster Autoscaler / AWS Load Balancer Controller / metrics-server
  charts and images from their respective upstreams.
  `n8n_image_pull_secrets` carries registry credentials for the n8n
  image and nothing else. Mirroring the whole set into a registry you
  control is possible, but the module exposes no inputs for pointing
  the charts and controller images at the mirror.

- **Backup/DR automation beyond RDS snapshots.** The module enables
  RDS automated backups (defaulting to RDS's own defaults). It does
  *not* automate restore drills, cross-region snapshot copy, S3
  versioning policy, or n8n encryption-key escrow. The
  `n8n_encryption_key` output is emitted exactly once at apply time;
  backing it up is the operator's job and is the single most
  important thing they will forget.

- **Bundled observability.** The module installs KEDA (for worker
  autoscaling) and metrics-server (for HPA on mains/webhooks) because
  they are load-bearing for the autoscaling story. It does *not*
  install Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OpenSearch, Datadog Agent, or
  any log shipper. `n8n_metrics_enabled` exposes the metrics
  endpoint; scrape configuration is the caller's monitoring stack.
  Rationale: observability stacks are deeply opinionated per-org;
  bundling one is more harmful than helpful.

## Examples

Six runnable examples ship with the module: three sizing tiers (`small`, `medium`, `large`) on Route 53, two DNS-variant examples (`cloudflare`, `godaddy`) at `small` sizing, and one topology-variant example (`split-ingress`) at `small` sizing. Sizing decisions for `medium` and `large` are derived from internal load testing.

| Dimension | [small](./examples/small/) (default) | [medium](./examples/medium/) | [large](./examples/large/) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Target scale | Dev / small team | ~5–15M exec/day | ~50–60+M exec/day |
| Avg req/s | ~10–30 | ~60–175 | ~350–960 |
| Node type | t3.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16 GB) | m6i.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GB) | m7i.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 64 GB) |
| Nodes desired / min / max | 3 / 3 / 6 | 5 / 5 / 15 | 10 / 10 / 50 |
| Total vCPU (desired) | 12 | 40 | 160 |
| Private subnets | 2× /24 (254 IPs each) | 2× /24 | 2× /20 (4,094 IPs each) |
| VPC CNI tuning | default | default | `WARM_ENI_TARGET=0` |
| Database | RDS db.t3.small (2 vCPU, 2 GB) | RDS db.m6g.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32 GB) | Aurora PostgreSQL I/O-Optimized |
| DB instances | 1 writer (Multi-AZ standby) | 1 writer (Multi-AZ standby) | 1 writer + 1 reader |
| DB storage | 50 GB gp2 | 200 GB gp3 | Aurora auto-scales to 128 TB |
| DB IOPS ceiling | 150 baseline / 3,000 burst | 3,000 baseline (gp3) | None — I/O-Optimized |
| PgBouncer | No | No | Yes — 2 replicas |
| Redis | cache.t3.medium | cache.r6g.large | cache.r6g.large |
| Redis nodes | 1 (no failover) | 1 (no failover) | 1 (no failover) |
| Webhook pods min / max | 2 / 50 | 5 / 50 | 30 / 80 |
| Worker pods min / max | 1 / 10 | 5 / 40 | 20 / 160 |
| Worker concurrency | 10 | 20 | 40 |
| Execution concurrency limit | 100 | 200 | 2,000 |
| Webhook memory limit | 1 Gi | 2 Gi | 4 Gi |
| Webhook memory request | 512 Mi | 512 Mi | 1 Gi |
| Pruning retention | 10k records / 14 days | 500k records / 7 days | 5M records / 24h |
| Est. cost / month (on-demand) | ~$440 | ~$2,000 | ~$21,000+ |
| Est. cost / month (1-yr reserved) | ~$285 | ~$1,300 | ~$13,600 |

The DNS-variant examples (`cloudflare`, `godaddy`) are sizing-equivalent to `small` — they only swap the DNS provider for cert validation and the alias record.

[`split-ingress`](./examples/split-ingress/) is also sizing-equivalent to `small`. It swaps the *topology* rather than the DNS provider: `create_ingress = false`, an internet-facing ALB serving only the webhook path prefixes (optionally behind a WAF), and an internal ALB serving the editor UI and REST API. It is the runnable version of the pattern described in the next section.

## Bring your own Ingress (two-ALB split)

> A complete, runnable version of everything in this section, including the
> certificate, both alias records and a WAF hook, is at
> [`examples/split-ingress/`](./examples/split-ingress/).

By default the module creates a single internet-facing ALB Ingress that routes
`/webhook` to the webhook processors and `/` to the mains. Some deployments need
to split that: a public, internet-facing ALB for `/webhook` so external systems
can deliver triggers, and a separate **internal** ALB for the editor UI and REST
API, reachable only over VPN or a peered network, optionally behind a WAF.

Set `create_ingress = false` and the module steps out of routing entirely. It
still creates everything the Ingresses point at, and it also stops managing the
Route 53 alias A-record and the `data.aws_lb` lookup behind it, so your own DNS
records are no longer reverted on the next `terraform plan`. The ACM certificate
is still issued when `route53_zone_id` is set, and remains usable by your own
Ingresses.

Route to the Services the module exposes as outputs:

| Output | Value | Serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `n8n_service_name` | `n8n-main` | Editor UI, REST API |
| `n8n_webhook_service_name` | `n8n-webhook-processor` | Webhooks, forms, waiting resumptions, MCP |
| `n8n_webhook_path_prefixes` | see below | The prefixes that must reach the processors |
| `n8n_service_port` | `5678` | Both |

### Route every webhook prefix, not just `/webhook`

The module runs the chart with `disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess = true`,
which disables **five** endpoint families on the main pods, not one. Each
returns 404 if it reaches `n8n-main`:

| Prefix | Breaks if misrouted |
| --- | --- |
| `/webhook` | Production webhook triggers |
| `/webhook-waiting` | Wait-node resumption, Slack and Telegram human-in-the-loop callbacks |
| `/form` | Form Trigger nodes |
| `/form-waiting` | Multi-page and waiting forms |
| `/mcp` | MCP server triggers |

`n8n_webhook_path_prefixes` returns this list so your Ingress stays in step with
the module as n8n adds endpoints. Iterate over it rather than hardcoding, and
declare the prefixes **before** any catch-all `/` rule.

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  source = "n8n-io/n8n/aws"

  create_ingress = false

  # Two ALBs need two hostnames: a DNS name can alias only one load balancer.
  # Setting route53_zone_id plus n8n_additional_domains makes the module issue
  # and validate one certificate covering both, consumed below through the
  # certificate_arn output. n8n_webhook_url makes n8n hand out webhook URLs on
  # the public host rather than the internal one.
  route53_zone_id        = var.route53_zone_id
  n8n_additional_domains = [var.webhook_domain]
  n8n_webhook_url        = "https://${var.webhook_domain}"

  # ... remaining inputs
}

# Public ALB: webhooks only, on its own hostname.
resource "kubernetes_ingress_v1" "webhook" {
  metadata {
    name      = "n8n-webhook-public"

    annotations = merge(
      {
        "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme"      = "internet-facing"
        "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type" = "ip"

        # The module-issued, already-validated certificate. It covers
        # webhook_domain because that name is in n8n_additional_domains.
        "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn" = module.n8n.certificate_arn
      },
      # Omit the key entirely when there is no WAF: a null annotation value
      # fails the plan.
      var.waf_acl_arn == null ? {} : {
        "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/wafv2-acl-arn" = var.waf_acl_arn
      },
    )
  }

  spec {
    ingress_class_name = "alb"
    rule {
      host = var.webhook_domain
      http {
        dynamic "path" {
          for_each = module.n8n.n8n_webhook_path_prefixes

          content {
            path      = path.value
            path_type = "Prefix"
            backend {
              service {
                name = module.n8n.n8n_webhook_service_name
                port { number = module.n8n.n8n_service_port }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  # The namespace output alone orders this after the namespace, but not after
  # the Helm release that creates the Services the ALB registers targets for.
  depends_on = [module.n8n]
}

# with scheme = "internal", on its own hostname (var.n8n_domain), routing "/"
# to module.n8n.n8n_service_name on the same port.
#
# Give that one the webhook prefixes too, ahead of its "/" rule. Otherwise
# the catch-all sends /webhook to the main pods, which serve none of it, and
# the request falls through to the editor's SPA handler and returns 200 with
# an HTML body: an in-VPC caller reads that as success while nothing ran.
```

## Customizing the module-managed Ingress

Before reaching for `create_ingress = false`, check whether the narrower inputs
cover you. They keep the module's single-apply DNS wiring intact:

- **`ingress_scheme`**: `internet-facing` (default) or `internal`. Use this
  when the whole deployment should be private rather than split in two.
- **`alb_inbound_cidrs`** and **`alb_inbound_prefix_list_ids`**: restrict which
  sources reach the ALB, while it stays public and keeps its public DNS name.
  Both default to `[]`, which leaves the ALB open to the internet, as it has
  always been. Set either one and the AWS Load Balancer Controller narrows the
  security group it manages for the ALB:

  ```hcl
  # Reachable only from the corporate egress ranges.
  alb_inbound_cidrs = ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.7/32"]

  # Or keep the ranges in a managed prefix list, edited in one place and shared
  # with other load balancers and security groups.
  alb_inbound_prefix_list_ids = [aws_ec2_managed_prefix_list.corp_egress.id]
  ```

  Setting both is a union, not an intersection. The restriction covers every
  listen port, so port 80 (the HTTPS redirect) is filtered too.

  **This also blocks inbound webhooks.** The module-managed ALB serves the
  webhook path prefixes alongside the editor UI, and a source restriction
  applies to the whole load balancer rather than per path. Slack, Stripe,
  GitHub, and Telegram senders outside the allow-list stop reaching n8n, and
  they see a connection timeout rather than an error you will find in the n8n
  logs. Reach for these inputs when nothing external calls in, or when every
  sender is on a known range. To lock down the editor while keeping webhooks
  public, run two load balancers instead: that is what
  [`examples/split-ingress/`](./examples/split-ingress/) is for.
- **`alb_ssl_policy`**: the TLS negotiation policy for the HTTPS listener,
  pinned to `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06` by default. Set it to any
  AWS-published `ELBSecurityPolicy-*` name to match a compliance baseline.
- **`ingress_annotations`**: a `map(string)` merged over the module's defaults
  (last write wins). This is the escape hatch for any AWS Load Balancer
  Controller feature the module has no opinion on, so you never need a fork to
  set one annotation:

  ```hcl
  ingress_annotations = {
    "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/wafv2-acl-arn"            = aws_wafv2_web_acl.n8n.arn
    "alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes" = "access_logs.s3.enabled=true,access_logs.s3.bucket=my-alb-logs"
  }
  ```

Eight caveats:

- Overriding `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes` drops the
  session stickiness that pins a browser to one main pod for 3 hours. Without
  it, WebSocket connections break as the ALB round-robins. Re-include
  `stickiness.enabled=true` if you set that key.
- Set the scheme through `ingress_scheme` and the TLS policy through
  `alb_ssl_policy`, not through `ingress_annotations`. Doing both raises a
  plan-time warning, because the annotation silently wins and the failure mode
  is an admin UI that is public when you meant it to be internal, or a TLS
  floor that never took effect.
- `alb_inbound_cidrs` narrows a public ALB; it is not the same as
  `ingress_scheme = "internal"`. The ALB stays in the public subnets with a
  public DNS name, and the allow-list is the only thing keeping other sources
  out. Choose `internal` when the deployment should not be on the public
  internet at all, and use the two together for defence in depth.
- Both source restrictions are ignored by the controller when
  `ingress_annotations` sets `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups`,
  because you then own the ALB's security group and the controller stops
  managing its rules. Nothing in the plan reveals this, so the module warns.
  Put the restriction in your own security group rules instead.
- `alb_inbound_cidrs` is IPv4 only, matching the ALB the module builds: it
  leaves the controller's default `ipv4` address type in place, so an IPv6 rule
  could never match a client. A dualstack ALB also needs a VPC and subnets
  carrying IPv6 CIDRs, which this module does not create. If you run one, set
  the allow-list on the annotation through `ingress_annotations` instead.
- An `IngressClassParams` setting `spec.inboundCIDRs` or `spec.prefixListsIDs`
  replaces the annotation rather than merging with it, but it cannot override
  these inputs. The controller only loads an IngressClass and its params for an
  Ingress it classifies through `spec.ingressClassName`, and the module-managed
  Ingress also carries the legacy `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation, which
  the controller matches first. Verified live against LBC v3.5.0. The immunity is
  incidental rather than designed, so it is worth knowing about: caller-owned
  Ingresses that set only `spec.ingressClassName`, including both of the ones in
  [`examples/split-ingress/`](./examples/split-ingress/), do not have it. See
  [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](./docs/troubleshooting.md#an-inbound-cidr-restriction-applies-cleanly-but-the-alb-still-answers-everyone)
  for the `kubectl` commands, and for the two preconditions that make the
  override possible at all, neither of which the LBC chart sets up by default.
- Prefix lists are heavier than they look. A security group rule referencing a
  managed prefix list counts against the rules-per-security-group quota
  (default 60) by the list's max-entries weight rather than as one rule, once
  per listen port, and the module's ALB listens on 80 and 443, so everything
  counts twice. A list too heavy to fit, and most AWS-managed lists are (the
  CloudFront origin-facing list weighs 55, needing 110 rules of the default
  60 by itself), takes the ALB offline for every source instead of failing the apply:
  the controller revokes the old rules, hits
  `RulesPerSecurityGroupLimitExceeded` authorizing the new ones, and leaves
  the security group with no ingress rules, so everything times out, webhooks
  included, while `terraform apply` reports success. Verified live against LBC
  v3.5.0. Keep `2 x (combined list weight + CIDR count)` at or under the
  quota, or raise quota `L-0EA8095F` first. See the
  [troubleshooting entry](./docs/troubleshooting.md#a-prefix-list-restriction-takes-the-alb-offline-for-every-source).
- Locking yourself out is recovered with `terraform apply`, not from the
  console. The controller owns the security group it created for the ALB and
  reverts hand-edits to it on the next reconcile.

Setting `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/inbound-cidrs` directly through
`ingress_annotations` was the only way to restrict the ALB before these inputs
existed, and it still works: `ingress_annotations` remains the last write. If
you are migrating, delete the annotation in the same change, or the stale value
keeps winning. The module raises a plan-time warning when both are set.

## Redis high availability

Redis backs two things n8n cannot run without in queue mode: the Bull queue
that distributes executions across workers, and the leader election that
coordinates the multi-main pods. By default the module provisions it as a
**single-node `aws_elasticache_cluster`**: cheapest, and a single point of
failure for both. A node failure or AZ event stalls executions and leader
election until ElastiCache replaces the node.

Set `redis_high_availability_enabled = true` to provision an
**`aws_elasticache_replication_group`** instead: one primary and one replica,
`automatic_failover_enabled` so ElastiCache promotes the replica on its own,
and `multi_az_enabled` so the replica lands in a second AZ rather than sharing
the primary's fate. Both nodes use `redis_node_type`, so **the Redis line of
the bill roughly doubles**.

The replication group also sets `at_rest_encryption_enabled`, which the
single-node cluster resource has no equivalent for. It is free on the
AWS-managed key and is set in the same release that introduces the resource on
purpose: the argument is ForceNew, so switching it on later would replace the
cache for everyone already running HA. Encryption **in transit** is a separate
concern and is not covered by this variable.

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...
  redis_high_availability_enabled = true
  redis_node_type                 = "cache.r6g.large"
}
```

### What this actually buys you, measured

The honest version, from a forced failover on a live cluster
(`aws elasticache test-failover`) rather than from the AWS marketing page:

| | Single node (default) | HA replication group |
|---|---|---|
| Queued executions after a node loss | **Gone** | **Survive** on the promoted replica |
| Time to a working queue | However long AWS takes to build a new node | ~20s promotion, pods back within a minute |
| n8n pods during the event | Restart | **Restart** |

The row that matters is the first one. HA does **not** make the failover
invisible to n8n: every main, worker and webhook pod exits and restarts while
it happens. n8n's `RedisClientService` calls `process.exit` once Redis has been
unreachable for `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` (10s by default) and logs
`Unable to connect to Redis after trying to connect for 10s / Exiting process
due to Redis connection error`. Raising that threshold to 30s was tried here
and only moved the exit later, which is why the module leaves it alone by
default. See
[Surviving a Redis failover without restarting](#surviving-a-redis-failover-without-restarting)
for why 30s failed and what does work.

That restart is a fail-fast by design, not a crash-loop: Kubernetes brings each
pod straight back, and the observed end-to-end recovery was under a minute with
the queue contents intact. So buy this for **durability of the queue**, and
plan for a brief pod-fleet restart, not for uninterrupted execution.

`QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_RECONNECT_ON_FAILOVER` (on by default since **n8n 2.10.0**)
covers the narrower case where the connection survives and the demoted primary
answers writes with `READONLY`. It did not prevent the restarts observed here,
because the client hit connect timeouts rather than `READONLY`.

### Surviving a Redis failover without restarting

`n8n_redis_timeout_threshold` sets `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD`, the
budget n8n spends trying to reach Redis before calling `process.exit`. It
defaults to `null`, leaving the chart's 10000 in place, which is what every
existing deployment already runs.

Raising it is the only lever this module has, and **the budget is much coarser
than the number suggests**. n8n does not set ioredis's `connectTimeout`, so it
stays at its 10s default, and a connect to a demoted primary hangs for that full
10s before failing. Each failed attempt therefore spends about 11.1s (1s retry
interval plus the 10s hang), and the threshold is effectively quantized:

| You set | Real budget | Reconnect attempts before exit |
|---|---|---|
| `10000` (default) | 11.1s | 1 |
| `30000` | 33.2s | 3 |
| `60000` | 66.4s | 6 |

Measured against a reproduction of the failure (two Redis instances and a
`/etc/hosts` flip standing in for the endpoint repointing, with n8n's exact
client options and a verbatim copy of its retry strategy):

| Endpoint stale for | Client recovered at | `10000` | `30000` | `60000` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15s | 33.4s | exits 21.2s | survives | survives |
| 25s | 44.5s | exits 21.4s | **exits 43.4s** | survives |

The second row is the live failure, reproduced: a 30s threshold fires **1.1
seconds before** the connection would have come back. That is the whole reason
raising it to 30s looked like it did nothing.

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...
  redis_high_availability_enabled = true
  n8n_redis_timeout_threshold     = 60000
}
```

#### Confirmed on a live cluster

A forced failover against a real ElastiCache replication group, with
`n8n_redis_timeout_threshold = 60000`: **no container terminated**, and every
pod logged `Recovered Redis connection` rather than exiting. n8n's own counter
shows the quantum predicted above, measured rather than inferred:

```text
Lost Redis connection. Trying to reconnect in 1s... (18.1s/60s)
Lost Redis connection. Trying to reconnect in 1s... (29.1s/60s)
Lost Redis connection. Trying to reconnect in 1s... (40.1s/60s)
Recovered Redis connection
```

Those gaps are 11.1s and 11.0s. A 30s threshold would have exited at the 40.1s
sample, about 11 seconds before recovery.

**The real endpoint stayed stale for 48 seconds**, roughly double the worst case
modelled above, measured by resolving the primary endpoint once a second from
inside the cluster. CoreDNS caching plus the endpoint's own TTL stretches the
window well past the promotion itself.

Two things worth knowing before you set it:

- **It is a trade, not a free win.** The threshold is also what makes a pod
  fail fast against a genuinely dead Redis. At 60s a real outage goes 60s
  before Kubernetes restarts anything. For a queue worker that is usually
  fine, since restarting does not help when Redis is gone either way.
- **60000 is a recommendation, not a guarantee.** It cleared a 48 second window
  with about 20 seconds of headroom, from a single observed failover. A slower
  repoint would eat that margin. If you need certainty rather than a good
  default, force a failover in your own account and read the counter.

The underlying issue belongs upstream: n8n leaves `connectTimeout` at 10s and
offers no way to change it, which is what makes the budget coarse. Lowering it
to 2s pulled recovery from 8.4s after the endpoint repointed down to 1.4s in the
same reproduction.

### Switching topologies replaces Redis

The two topologies are **different Terraform resource types**, so a `moved`
block cannot bridge them. Flipping the toggle on a default deployment destroys
the cache and creates the replacement, and **everything queued or in flight at
that moment is lost**. This is a maintenance-window operation:

1. Stop new work reaching n8n (pause the schedule triggers, or take the
   webhook path out of the load balancer).
2. Let the workers drain. `bull:jobs:wait` and `bull:jobs:active` at zero is
   the signal, and they are the same two keys the KEDA triggers watch.
3. `terraform apply`. Expect one destroy and one create on the Redis tier, and
   an in-place update to the Helm release as it repoints at the new host.
4. Resume traffic.

The replication group deliberately carries a **different identifier** from the
single-node cluster (`<cluster_name>-redis-rg` rather than
`<cluster_name>-redis`). ElastiCache shares one identifier namespace between
cache clusters and replication groups and rejects a second resource reusing the
name:

```text
InvalidParameterValue: Cannot have a cluster and replication group with
same identifier. Please use a different identifier.
```

The two resources are independent, so Terraform is free to create the new one
while the old one still exists. With a shared name the apply would destroy the
old cache and then fail to create the replacement, leaving the deployment with
no queue backend and needing a second apply to recover. The distinct suffix
makes enabling and disabling each a single apply.

The suffix reads `-redis-rg` (replication group) rather than `-redis-ha`
because the resource is not exclusive to high availability.
`redis_transit_encryption_enabled` selects it too, for an unrelated reason. See
[Redis in-transit encryption and AUTH](#redis-in-transit-encryption-and-auth)
for the full matrix.

That sharing is also the one case where enabling high availability does **not**
replace anything. A deployment already running with
`redis_transit_encryption_enabled = true` is on a replication group, so
Terraform plans the change as an in-place modification, raising the node count
through ElastiCache's `IncreaseReplicaCount` API rather than rebuilding. The
provider converges that change in stages, so one apply does not enable automatic
failover. Follow [Adding high availability to an encrypted group](#adding-high-availability-to-an-encrypted-group)
for the measured sequence, and still drain first.

## Redis in-transit encryption and AUTH

By default the module secures its ElastiCache queue backend by **network
boundary**: Redis sits in private subnets behind a security group that admits
only VPC traffic, with no TLS and no credentials. That is a defensible posture
inside a trusted VPC and it is the module's accepted as-built behaviour, but it
leaves two things open. Queue payloads (workflow execution data) cross the VPC
in cleartext, and anything that reaches the network boundary reaches Redis
unauthenticated.

Set `redis_transit_encryption_enabled = true` to close both. The module then
enables TLS in transit, generates an AUTH token, publishes it as a Kubernetes
secret, and wires `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TLS` plus `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD` onto
every n8n container. Retrieve the token with:

```bash
terraform output -raw redis_auth_token
```

The generated token respects ElastiCache's constraints: 16 to 128 characters,
with `! & # $ ^ < > -` the only permitted non-alphanumerics. A broader special
set is rejected by AWS at create time.

### It uses the same replication group high availability does

`auth_token` is not available on `aws_elasticache_cluster`. AWS exposes it only
on `aws_elasticache_replication_group`, and only when transit encryption is
already enabled. A third variable, `redis_kms_encryption_enabled`, lands on
the same resource for the same reason: `kms_key_id` is also
replication-group-only. So all three of `redis_high_availability_enabled`,
`redis_transit_encryption_enabled` and `redis_kms_encryption_enabled` select
the replication group, each for an unrelated reason, and **any one alone is
enough to move off the default cluster resource**:

| `redis_high_availability_enabled` | `redis_transit_encryption_enabled` | `redis_kms_encryption_enabled` | Resource | Nodes | Failover | TLS + AUTH | KMS key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `false` | `false` | `false` | `aws_elasticache_cluster` | 1 | no | no | none |
| `true` | `false` | `false` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 2, Multi-AZ | yes | no | ElastiCache-managed |
| `false` | `true` | `false` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 1 | no | yes | ElastiCache-managed |
| `false` | `false` | `true` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 1 | no | no | customer-managed |
| `true` | `true` | `false` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 2, Multi-AZ | yes | yes | ElastiCache-managed |
| `true` | `false` | `true` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 2, Multi-AZ | yes | no | customer-managed |
| `false` | `true` | `true` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 1 | no | yes | customer-managed |
| `true` | `true` | `true` | `aws_elasticache_replication_group` | 2, Multi-AZ | yes | yes | customer-managed |

The three are independent. Encryption does not buy you a replica, so enabling
it alone leaves the cache single-node and the bill unchanged; availability
does not buy you a credential, so enabling that alone leaves the endpoint
plaintext; a customer-managed key does not buy you either, so enabling that
alone changes nothing about node count, failover, or transit encryption.
`redis_kms_encryption_enabled` defaults to `false` to avoid replacing an
existing standalone cache and dropping its queue. That default
`aws_elasticache_cluster` is **not encrypted at rest**: Redis OSS at-rest
encryption is available only on replication groups. Any HA- or TLS-selected
replication group is encrypted with the ElastiCache-managed key; enabling the
CMK toggle selects the same resource and replaces that key with the module CMK.

Because all three land on **one** resource with one identifier
(`<cluster_name>-redis-rg`), turning any later one on *plans* as a
modification of the replication group you already have rather than a
replacement, as long as at least one of the three was already true. Turning
on the first of the three is what forces the initial replacement, whichever
one that is.

### Adding high availability to an encrypted group

This direction is in place, but it takes more than one plan-and-apply cycle. The
AWS provider handles the replica count before automatic failover: the first
apply calls ElastiCache's `IncreaseReplicaCount` API, waits for the replica, and
returns with automatic failover still disabled. A fresh plan then proposes the
remaining automatic-failover change.

Use this sequence:

1. Drain the queue, set `redis_high_availability_enabled = true`, and apply.
   Expect one in-place replication-group update that raises the node count from
   one to two. It does not replace Redis.
2. Wait until the replication group is `available`, then plan and apply again.
   With the default `redis_apply_immediately = false`, AWS records
   `AutomaticFailoverStatus = "enabled"` in `PendingModifiedValues` and activates
   it in the next maintenance window. To activate it now, set
   `redis_apply_immediately = true` for this apply.
3. Wait for AWS to report automatic failover as `enabled`, then run one final
   plan. Remove `redis_apply_immediately = true` if you used it; the final plan
   should be empty.

This sequence was verified on a live encrypted replication group. The replica
landed in a second availability zone without replacing the group. A forced
failover then promoted it in 22 seconds. Authenticated Redis probes recovered
after approximately 26 to 31 seconds, `/healthz` stayed available, and every
n8n pod kept the same UID and zero restart count with
`n8n_redis_timeout_threshold = 60000`.

**Adding encryption to a plaintext replication group** works, but not in one
apply, and not with `redis_transit_encryption_enabled` alone. See the next
section.

### Adding TLS to an existing replication group

Setting `redis_transit_encryption_enabled = true` on a deployment that already
runs `redis_high_availability_enabled = true` plans as a clean in-place modify
and then **fails at apply**. AWS refuses a direct plaintext-to-encrypted
transition:

```text
InvalidParameterCombination: Direct transition from transit-encryption-disabled
to transit-encryption-enabled is not allowed. Update the cluster to
transit-encryption-mode preferred prior to enabling transit encryption.
```

That is not a dead end. `preferred` is a mode in which the endpoint accepts TLS
**and** plaintext at the same time, which is exactly what a migration needs, and
`redis_transit_encryption_mode` plus `redis_apply_immediately` exist to drive
it. The sequence below was run end to end against a live ElastiCache
replication group with a client holding a connection open throughout, and **no
step interrupted service**.

#### Step 1 of 3: accept TLS alongside plaintext

```hcl
redis_high_availability_enabled  = true
redis_transit_encryption_enabled = true
redis_transit_encryption_mode    = "preferred"   # <- the migration lever
redis_apply_immediately          = true          # <- AWS rejects the change without it
```

Took **17 minutes 27 seconds**. Throughout, a plaintext connection opened before
the change and held open answered every `PING`, and new plaintext connections
kept succeeding: 1198 consecutive replies on the held-open connection and 1192
on fresh ones, with zero errors. TLS starts working the moment the change lands.

Terraform rolls the n8n pods onto TLS in the same apply. Pods that have not
rolled yet keep working, because plaintext is still accepted.

No AUTH token is created in this step. AWS will not accept one in `preferred`
mode, so the module does not generate it, publish the Secret, or set
`passwordFromEnv` on the KEDA triggers until the mode is `required`.

> [!WARNING]
> While the mode is `preferred`, Redis is reachable **unencrypted and
> unauthenticated** by anything in the VPC. A `check` block warns on every apply
> for as long as you stay there. Do not park here.

#### Step 2 of 3: close plaintext and introduce the token

```hcl
redis_transit_encryption_mode = "required"
redis_apply_immediately       = true
```

One apply, **8 minutes 18 seconds**. Terraform issues this as two API calls: the
mode change first, then the AUTH token behind it. That ordering is what makes it
work at all, since AWS rejects a token supplied in the same call as the move to
`required`, with the same message it uses in `preferred`:

```text
InvalidParameterValue: The AUTH token modification is only supported when
encryption-in-transit is enabled.
```

Plaintext stops being accepted partway through: measured at **131 seconds**
after the change was issued, the held-open plaintext connection was closed by
the server and new plaintext connections began timing out. Nothing was using
plaintext by then, because step 1 already moved the pods to TLS.

The endpoint hostname also changes shape here, from
`<group>.<id>.ng.0001.<region>.cache.amazonaws.com` to
`master.<group>.<id>.<region>.cache.amazonaws.com`. Both resolve during the
migration; the old name is retired when this step completes. Terraform picks up
the new one and rewrites the Helm values in the same apply, so nothing needs
doing by hand.

#### Step 3 of 3: actually require the token

**This step is not optional.** The token in step 2 is introduced with
ElastiCache's `ROTATE` strategy, which by design keeps the *previous* credential
valid so clients that have not restarted are not locked out. For a group that
had no token, the previous credential is *no credential at all*, so after step 2
the endpoint still answers unauthenticated connections:

```console
$ redis-cli -h master.<group>.<id>.<region>.cache.amazonaws.com --tls ping
PONG          # <- with no token supplied
```

Rotate once more to close it:

```bash
terraform apply -replace='module.n8n.random_password.redis_auth_token[0]'
```

Seconds, not minutes. Afterwards an unauthenticated connection is refused, and
**both** the old and the new token still work, so the pod roll this triggers has
no lockout window:

```console
$ redis-cli -h ... --tls ping
NOAUTH Authentication required.
```

#### None of this applies to a new deployment

Creating Redis with `redis_transit_encryption_enabled = true` from the start
gives you TLS and a required token in a single apply, because the group is
created encrypted rather than modified into it. `redis_transit_encryption_mode`
defaults to `required` and `redis_apply_immediately` to `false`, so a first-time
caller never touches either.

#### Or replace the group instead

If a maintenance window is cheaper than three applies:

```bash
terraform apply -replace='module.n8n.aws_elasticache_replication_group.n8n[0]'
```

That destroys the group and builds an encrypted one in one step, and every
queued job goes with it. Drain workers first.

> [!WARNING]
> **Enabling this on a default deployment replaces Redis.** The cluster and the
> replication group are different resource types, so flipping the flag destroys
> one and creates the other, dropping every job queued at that moment. Drain

>

> deployments plan `No changes.`

### `create_elasticache = false` is not compatible

The module cannot put TLS or a token on a Redis it does not manage, so this
combination is rejected at plan time rather than applied. Terminate TLS on your
own endpoint and leave this variable at its default. See
[Bring your own Redis](#bring-your-own-redis).

### Worker autoscaling

Queue-depth autoscaling keeps working with the flag on. Both worker triggers
gain `enableTLS` and a reference to the AUTH token, so KEDA reads queue depth
over the same encrypted, authenticated connection the workers use.

TLS is the half that has to land. Without it KEDA opens a plaintext connection
to a TLS-only endpoint and hangs on `connection to redis failed: i/o timeout`
before authentication is ever attempted. Nothing crashes: the HPA simply
reports `<unknown>` and workers freeze at their current replica count, so
credentials alone would read as no fix at all.

The token is not written into the ScaledObject. The trigger carries
`passwordFromEnv: QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD`, which names an environment
variable rather than a value, and KEDA resolves it against the worker pod's
first container, following the `secretKeyRef` the chart already sets there.
Nothing sensitive lands in a manifest, and no `TriggerAuthentication` resource
is needed.

This depends on KEDA being allowed to read Secrets outside its own namespace,
which its chart permits by default. If you install KEDA yourself with
`KEDA_RESTRICT_SECRET_ACCESS=true`, or set
`permissions.operator.restrict.secret` or
`permissions.metricServer.restrict.secret` to `true`, the token cannot be
resolved and queue-depth scaling will stall.

## Bring your own Redis

`create_elasticache = false` is the Redis-tier counterpart to
`create_database = false`. The module then creates **no** ElastiCache cluster,
replication group, subnet group, or security group, and wires both n8n and the
KEDA queue-depth triggers at the endpoint you supply:

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...
  create_elasticache = false
  redis_host         = aws_elasticache_replication_group.shared.primary_endpoint_address
  redis_port         = 6379 # the default
}
```

This is the hook the cross-region HA/DR design depends on: both regions point
at one shared, replication-capable Redis rather than each running its own.

Two constraints worth knowing before you reach for it:

- **The endpoint must be reachable from the EKS node subnets** on `redis_port`.
  The module creates no security group on this path, so the rules that let the
  nodes in are yours to write.
- **No AUTH, no TLS.** The module wires host and port only. An external Redis
  that requires a password or TLS is not supported on this path yet.

Point `redis_host` at a **primary endpoint** rather than a node address when
the Redis you supply is itself a replication group, so the name follows the
primary across a failover.

Getting the toggle and the inputs out of step is the easy mistake here, and it
fails quietly rather than loudly: `create_elasticache` defaults to `true`, so
setting `redis_host` alone gets you a module-managed ElastiCache and n8n queued
onto *that*, while the Redis you supplied sits idle. Both exist, the apply
succeeds, and the executions land somewhere you are not watching. The module
raises a `check` warning for that case, and for its inverse (tuning
`redis_node_type` or `redis_high_availability_enabled` while
`create_elasticache = false`, where neither reaches anything).

## KMS key after `terraform destroy`

The module-managed DB, EKS, S3, and optional Redis keys use
`deletion_window_in_days = 7` (the AWS minimum), so Terraform schedules them
for deletion 7 days out rather than removing them immediately. A key in
`PendingDeletion` cannot decrypt data: access stops as soon as deletion is
scheduled, while permanent loss occurs when the seven-day window completes.
Two operational consequences:

- **Cost:** ~$1/month prorated, ~$0.23 per destroy cycle. Negligible but
  non-zero.
- **Repeat applies inside the window:** every module KMS alias uses `name_prefix`
  (not a fixed `name`), so apply → destroy → apply works cleanly within the
  7-day window — each apply gets a fresh alias suffix. If you need to recover
  a scheduled-for-deletion key, run `aws kms cancel-key-deletion --key-id
  <key-id>`, then `aws kms enable-key --key-id <key-id>`, and import it back
  into state. Use the matching address: `aws_kms_key.db[0]`,
  `aws_kms_key.eks[0]`, `aws_kms_key.s3[0]`, or `aws_kms_key.redis[0]`.

Do not change `s3_kms_encryption_enabled` from `true` to `false` while retained
objects still use `aws_kms_key.s3`: changing the bucket default affects only
new writes, but Terraform also schedules the old key for deletion immediately.
Re-encrypt every retained object under SSE-S3 or another retained key before
disabling the module CMK.

## Custom n8n images

`n8n_image_repository` points the Helm release at an image you build, instead
of the chart's `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n`. Typical reasons: an internal base
image, extra system dependencies your workflows shell out to, or
**community packages** baked in. That last one is the motivating case: n8n
installs community packages onto the pod's filesystem, which is ephemeral in
EKS, so the only way to keep UI-installed nodes working across reschedules is
`n8n_reinstall_missing_packages = true`, an npm install on every pod boot. A
package with a large dependency tree makes every rollout CPU and memory heavy
([#52](https://github.com/n8n-io/terraform-aws-n8n/issues/52)).

Deploying a custom image is the easy half:

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...other inputs...

  n8n_image_repository = "123456789012.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/n8n"
  n8n_image_tag        = "2.27.4-mypackages"

  # The chart derives the task runner sidecar's tag from the app image's tag,
  # and no n8nio/runners:2.27.4-mypackages exists. Pin the n8n version the
  # custom image is built from, or main and worker pods land in
  # ImagePullBackOff.
  n8n_task_runner_image_tag = "2.27.4"

  # Not needed any more: the packages are in the image.
  n8n_reinstall_missing_packages = false
}
```

Three things to know about the inputs:

- **Repository and tag are separate inputs.** The chart renders
  `{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}`, so a tag or digest
  inlined into `n8n_image_repository` is rejected at plan time. Setting the
  repository without a tag is accepted but warns: the chart then appends its
  own `stable`, which most private registries do not publish.
- **`n8n_task_runner_image_tag` is usually required alongside a custom tag.**
  Task runners are enabled by default (`n8n_task_runners_enabled = true`) and
  the sidecar image is `n8nio/runners`, tagged from `image.tag` unless
  overridden. Only skip the override when your tag happens to be a published
  n8n version. A plan-time warning fires when it looks like you forgot.
- **Pull access comes from the node group by default.** With
  `n8n_image_pull_secrets` empty, the image has to be pullable by the node
  group's IAM role, which covers a public registry and any ECR repository in
  this account (the module already attaches
  `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`). For a private registry that issues
  static credentials, put the name of a `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`
  secret in `n8n_image_pull_secrets`. For **cross-account ECR**, do neither:
  an ECR authorization token expires after 12 hours, so a pull secret holding
  one is stale long before the next apply. Add the node group role to the
  source registry's repository policy instead, using the
  `node_group_role_arn` output as the principal.

  The pinned chart renders `imagePullSecrets` nowhere, so
  `n8n_image_pull_secrets` reaches the pods the only way left: the module
  creates the n8n ServiceAccount itself with the secrets attached, and passes
  `serviceAccount.create = false`. The chart documents that arrangement. Two
  consequences worth knowing before you set it. The module's account is named
  `n8n-enterprise-pull` rather than the chart's `n8n-enterprise`, so that
  enabling this on a running deployment creates a new account alongside the
  one Helm still owns instead of colliding with it; the S3 Pod Identity
  association follows whichever name is in play. Changing the association's
  service account replaces it, so pods running under the old name briefly
  cannot refresh their S3 credentials until the same apply's rollout
  repoints them, which it does within minutes and cached credentials
  outlive. And the secrets are yours to create and
  rotate: the module takes names, not credentials, so nothing lands in
  Terraform state that a `terraform show` would leak.

Keep the custom image's n8n version in step with what you would otherwise pin
via `n8n_image_tag`: it is now your responsibility to rebuild for n8n upgrades
and security patches.

### Getting baked-in nodes to actually load

Putting the packages in the image is not enough, and the natural instinct is
wrong: **a plain `npm install` into the image's `node_modules` does not load.**
n8n dropped that in 1.0 ("n8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global
`node_modules` directory", [v10 migration
guide](https://docs.n8n.io/changelog/v10-migration-guide/)), and the loader
confirms it: `packages/cli/src/load-nodes-and-credentials.ts` scans only
`n8n-nodes-base`, `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain`, and the custom directories at
startup. Community packages are loaded separately, per row in the
`installed_packages` table, from `~/.n8n/nodes/node_modules`.

`n8n_custom_extensions_path` is the supported route. It sets
`N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS` on all three pod types, pointing n8n at a directory your
image populated:

```dockerfile
FROM docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:2.27.4
USER root
RUN mkdir -p /opt/n8n-nodes && cd /opt/n8n-nodes && \
    npm install --omit=dev n8n-nodes-example@1.4.0
USER node
```

```hcl
  n8n_image_repository       = "123456789012.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/n8n"
  n8n_image_tag              = "2.27.4-mypackages"
  n8n_task_runner_image_tag  = "2.27.4"
  n8n_custom_extensions_path = "/opt/n8n-nodes"
```

The path must sit **outside `/home/node/.n8n`**, and the module rejects anything
under it at plan time. The chart mounts a volume there on the *main* deployment
only (`emptyDir`, since the module leaves `persistence.enabled` at the chart
default), so an image that baked nodes into `~/.n8n/custom` or `~/.n8n/nodes`
would have them hidden on mains while workers and webhook processors still see
them: workflows that execute fine but cannot be opened in the editor. That also
rules out the alternative of baking into `~/.n8n/nodes/node_modules` to satisfy
existing `installed_packages` rows.

#### Mounting the nodes instead of baking them

Rebuilding an image for every package change is not always the trade you want.
`n8n_extra_volumes` and `n8n_extra_volume_mounts` put the same directory in
front of n8n from a ConfigMap, a Secret, or a ReadWriteMany claim, and the
plan-time warning about an empty extensions path recognises a mount that covers
the path just as it recognises a custom image:

```hcl
  n8n_custom_extensions_path = "/opt/n8n-nodes"

  n8n_extra_volumes = [
    {
      name                    = "custom-nodes"
      persistent_volume_claim = { claim_name = "n8n-nodes-efs", read_only = true }
    },
  ]

  n8n_extra_volume_mounts = [
    { name = "custom-nodes", mount_path = "/opt/n8n-nodes" },
  ]
```

The volumes land on main, worker and webhook-processor pods alike, on the n8n
container only. Everything above about the `CUSTOM.*` rename and the
`/home/node/.n8n` shadowing applies here too: the loader does not care where
the files came from.

Which route to pick comes down to how the nodes are built. A ConfigMap caps out
at 1 MiB and holds no `node_modules` tree of any size, so it suits a handful of
hand-written `.node.js` files and nothing more. A ReadWriteMany claim (EFS on
EKS) takes a full install and can be updated without a rollout, at the cost of
running a filesystem and having no record in Terraform of what is on it. A
custom image is the only one of the three where the exact node set is pinned to
an image tag and rolls out with the usual deployment semantics, which is why it
stays the recommended route for anything long-lived.

`persistence` is deliberately not exposed. Turning it on swaps the main pods'
`emptyDir` at `/home/node/.n8n` for a PVC, and that solves nothing here: the
claim is `ReadWriteOnce`, which cannot serve the two main replicas this module
runs (`multiMain.replicas = 2`, plus an HPA above that), and it never reaches
workers or webhook processors at all, so nodes stored there would load on some
pod types and not others. Use `n8n_extra_volumes` for storage that has to be
shared.

Two limits worth knowing before you commit to this:

- **Node types are renamed.** The custom directory loader registers everything
  under the package name `CUSTOM` (`postProcessLoaders` builds every type as
  `${packageName}.${type}`, and `CustomDirectoryLoader.packageName` is the
  literal `CUSTOM`). A node that was `n8n-nodes-example.myNode` when installed
  from npm becomes `CUSTOM.myNode`, so **existing workflows built on the
  UI-installed copy will not resolve**. There is no alias or remap facility in
  n8n to bridge the two names, so migrating an instance that already has
  community packages in use means rewriting node types.

  Precisely what a stale workflow does, since the failure is deferred and
  therefore easy to miss:

  - Node lookup is keyed on the package name (`loaders[packageName]` in
    `getNode`), so `n8n-nodes-example.myNode` asks for a loader that no longer
    exists and raises `Unrecognized node type: n8n-nodes-example.myNode`.
  - The workflow still opens and saves. `Workflow`'s constructor deliberately
    skips unknown types rather than throwing, so nothing fails at load; the
    editor just shows `"'<type>' is an unknown node type"`. The error arrives
    only when that node executes.
  - The `installed_packages` rows live in Postgres, not on the pod, so they
    survive the switch to a baked image. At startup `checkForMissingPackages`
    compares them against the loaded types, the `CUSTOM.*` names do not match,
    and the old package is flagged `failedLoading` in the Community Nodes
    screen even though the same nodes are present under `CUSTOM.*`.
  - **Do not pair this with `n8n_reinstall_missing_packages = true`.** Those
    same rows make every pod npm-install the packages again at boot, which is
    the rollout cost baking them in was meant to remove, and you end up with
    both copies loaded under different names. Leave it at its `false` default
    when you bake.
- **One directory only.** n8n accepts a `;`-separated list, but every custom
  directory is registered under the same `CUSTOM` key and each overwrites the
  last, so all but the final directory are silently dropped. The module exposes
  a single path and rejects a semicolon rather than let you lose nodes to it.
  Install everything into one directory.

After applying, verify it worked with
[`tests/scripts/verify-custom-image.sh`](tests/scripts/README.md#custom-image-verification).
Baked nodes that fail to load do not make the deployment unhealthy, so nothing
else surfaces the problem: the script checks that n8n actually loaded them, that
it loaded them on workers as well as mains, and reports the `CUSTOM.*` names it
found.

If the goal is a reproducible node inventory rather than avoiding boot-time
installs, n8n's own `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_MANAGED_BY_ENV` +
`N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES` reconciles a declared package list on every startup and
locks the UI read-only. It keeps real package names, still installs at boot, and
is settable today through `n8n_extra_env`.

This was run end to end on a throwaway EKS deployment of `examples/small`
(chart `1.10.0`, n8n `2.33.1`), building the image above with a real community
package and applying the four inputs together. What that confirmed:

- The baked node loads. n8n's own generated type list on the main pod contained
  `CUSTOM.textManipulation`, and `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS` was present on the
  main, worker and webhook-processor pods.
- The rename is real, not theoretical. `n8n-nodes-text-manipulation` registered
  as `CUSTOM.textManipulation`, exactly as the loader source predicts.
- `/home/node/.n8n` really is shadowed, and only on mains. A marker file baked
  into the image at that path was missing on the main pods and present on
  workers and webhook processors, while a marker at `/opt/n8n-nodes` in the same
  image was visible everywhere.
- A same-account ECR repository needs no `imagePullSecrets`: the node group
  role's `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` is enough.
- A path set with no custom image really is silent. Pods stayed `Running` with
  no restarts, loaded zero `CUSTOM.*` types, and logged nothing about the
  missing directory, which is why the module warns about it at plan time.
- The node runs, not just loads. A workflow using the baked node executed
  successfully through both a manual run and a production webhook, and the
  worker pod logged picking the job up, so main and workers resolve the same
  custom type.

If a custom image is more than you want to maintain, `n8n_community_packages_registry`
points community-package installs at a private npm mirror instead
(`N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_REGISTRY`), which helps when egress to
`registry.npmjs.org` is blocked or packages are vendored internally. It still
installs at boot, so it does not solve the rollout cost either. **Check your
license entitlement first:** n8n throws `FeatureNotLicensedError` for any
registry other than `registry.npmjs.org` unless the instance is entitled to
`COMMUNITY_NODES_CUSTOM_REGISTRY`, so on an instance without it this input
breaks community-package installs rather than redirecting them. That the value
is honoured at all was confirmed live by A/B: with the input pointed at an
unreachable host the install failed with `Failed to execute npm registry
request`, and with the input removed the same package installed from the
default registry. A mirror
requiring authentication also needs `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_AUTH_TOKEN`, which
the module does not manage; pass it through `n8n_extra_env`, noting that those
values are stored in plaintext in the Helm release and Terraform state.

## Execution data in S3 (Enterprise)

The module always stores n8n's **binary** data in S3. From **n8n 2.27** the
**execution** data itself can be offloaded to the same bucket instead of
PostgreSQL. Execution-data writes are usually the dominant write load on the
n8n database at volume, so this is the main lever for relieving RDS pressure in
the queue-mode topology this module deploys:

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...other inputs...

  n8n_execution_data_storage_mode = "s3"   # default: "database"
  n8n_image_tag                   = "2.27.4"
}
```

The module sets `N8N_EXECUTION_DATA_STORAGE_MODE=s3` on the Helm release's
`config.extraEnv`, so it lands on **every** n8n container (main, worker, and
webhook processor), which is what the
[n8n external storage docs](https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/scaling/use-external-storage)
require in queue mode. Nothing else has to be wired up: the bucket, the IAM
policy, the Pod Identity role, and the `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_*` connection
already exist for binary data and are reused as-is.

All six examples expose this as a passthrough variable, each left at `"database"`
so they still run unchanged. Volume rises with the tier, but headroom falls with
it: everything at `small` sizing (`small`, `cloudflare`, `godaddy`,
`split-ingress`) runs `db.t3.small` on 50 GB of gp2 with a 150 IOPS baseline,
where sustained execution-data writes burn burst credits and fill the volume,
while `large` runs Aurora I/O-Optimized with no IOPS ceiling. So the smallest
deployments are the ones that feel execution-data growth soonest, and reaching
for `"s3"` there is often cheaper than resizing the database.

- **Requires n8n >= 2.27.** Pin `n8n_image_tag` accordingly. The chart default
  is the floating `stable` tag, so leaving it unpinned means the version each
  pod gets is whatever is latest when it starts.
- **Requires an Enterprise license** carrying the `feat:executionDataS3`
  entitlement (the module already requires `n8n_license_key`). Note that this is
  a **different** entitlement from the `feat:binaryDataS3` one that the module's
  always-on binary data offload uses, so a license that already puts binary data
  in S3 does not necessarily cover execution data. Check before flipping the
  mode, from any running main pod:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n n8n exec deploy/n8n-main -c n8n-main -- n8n license:info | grep -o 'feat:executionDataS3":[a-z]*'
  ```

  n8n **refuses to start** in `s3` mode without the entitlement, so a license
  gap here takes every pod down, not just the feature. Verified against an
  unlicensed instance, which crash-loops on:

  ```text
  S3 execution data storage requires a valid license. Either set
  `N8N_EXECUTION_DATA_STORAGE_MODE` to something else, or upgrade to a license
  that supports this feature.
  ```

  The Helm release runs with `atomic = true` and `wait = true`, so that fails
  the apply and rolls the release back rather than degrading quietly.
  Entitlements are not visible at plan time, so no `check` block can catch this
  ahead of the apply.

  In practice you are unlikely to see that specific message first. This module
  puts **binary** data in S3 unconditionally, and that gate is checked earlier,
  so an unlicensed deployment fails on `S3 binary data storage requires a valid
  license` before execution data is ever reached. Either way the symptom is the
  same: pods do not start.

  One caveat worth knowing before you try to reproduce that: **clearing
  `n8n_license_key` does not de-license a running deployment.** n8n caches the
  activation result in the database (`settings.license.cert`) and loads it at
  startup, so blanking the input applies cleanly, leaves every pod licensed, and
  keeps writing execution data to S3. The startup gate is therefore reached on a
  deployment with no cached cert, not on one you de-key after the fact.
- **No backfill.** Only new executions are written to S3, under
  `workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/execution_data/bundle.json`.
  n8n records the destination per execution, in `execution_entity.storedAt`
  (`db` or `s3`), so switching modes is non-destructive in both directions:
  existing executions stay readable in PostgreSQL, and executions already in S3
  stay readable after switching back, as long as the bucket stays configured.
- **The payload leaves the database entirely.** In `s3` mode n8n writes no
  `execution_data` row at all, rather than a row holding a pointer, so the write
  it saves is the whole bundle. `execution_entity` still gets its row (status,
  timings, `jsonSizeBytes`), which is what the executions list reads, so the UI
  stays responsive without touching S3.
- **Pruning stays with n8n.** The executions hard-delete path removes the S3
  bundle together with the database record, driven by the same
  `n8n_pruning_max_age` / `n8n_pruning_max_count` settings.

### Durability: this weakens the backup posture of execution data

Worth deciding on deliberately, because the two stores are not equivalent:

| | Execution data in `database` | Execution data in `s3` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backups | RDS automated backups, `db_backup_retention_period` (default **7 days**) | **None.** The module creates no `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` and no replication |
| Point-in-time recovery | Yes, within the retention window | No |
| Survives `terraform destroy` | Only via a manual snapshot taken beforehand: the instance sets `skip_final_snapshot = true` and `delete_automated_backups = true` | **No.** `force_destroy = true` on the bucket deletes the objects |

So `s3` mode trades RDS write pressure for execution history that has no
recovery path: an accidental `terraform destroy`, or a lifecycle rule that
reaches `execution_data/` (see below), loses it outright. This was already the
posture for binary attachments; `s3` mode extends it to execution history.

If execution history matters to you, close the gap yourself on the bucket
exported as the `s3_bucket_name` output: enable versioning, add
[S3 Versioning + MFA delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)
or a replication rule, or take periodic copies. Note that versioning interacts
with `force_destroy` (Terraform must delete every version to drop the bucket)
and with any lifecycle rule you add, which then needs
`noncurrent_version_expiration` to keep old versions from accumulating.

### S3 lifecycle rules on the shared bucket

The module creates **no** lifecycle configuration on its bucket. If you add one
of your own (the bucket name is exported as the `s3_bucket_name` output), read
this first, because the two data types have **opposite** requirements:

| Data type      | Object keys                                                  | Who prunes                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Binary data    | `workflows/{wf}/executions/{exec}/binary_data/{fileId}`       | **S3.** n8n delegates it, so a lifecycle rule is the only thing that ever deletes these |
| Execution data | `workflows/{wf}/executions/{exec}/execution_data/bundle.json` | **n8n.** A lifecycle rule can delete bundles n8n still references |

That split is observed behaviour, not inference. On a live deployment (n8n
2.33.1, this module's defaults), deleting two executions removed their
`execution_data/bundle.json` objects straight away and left both
`binary_data/` objects sitting in the bucket. **Orphaned binary data is the
normal steady state**, not an edge case, which is what makes a lifecycle rule
worth having in the first place.

A bucket-wide expiration rule therefore does the right thing for binary data
and the wrong thing for execution data. **It cannot be narrowed to only binary
data on a shared bucket:** S3 lifecycle filters match on a literal key
**prefix** (no wildcards), both key layouts share the same
`workflows/{wf}/executions/{exec}/` prefix, and the segment that tells them
apart comes *after* the two variable IDs. n8n tags neither object, so a tag
filter is not an option either.

So, with `n8n_execution_data_storage_mode = "s3"`, pick deliberately:

- **No lifecycle rule** (safe for execution data). Binary data then accumulates
  indefinitely and its storage cost grows without bound, so budget for it or
  reclaim it with an out-of-band job that deletes only `binary_data/` keys.
- **A lifecycle rule long enough to be harmless.** Set the expiration well
  beyond the retention n8n itself enforces (`n8n_pruning_max_age`, default 336h
  / 14 days) so n8n has already hard-deleted an execution before S3 could reach
  its bundle. This is a bound on the *worst* case, not a guarantee: pruning is
  also capped by `n8n_pruning_max_count`, and anything that stalls the prune
  loop widens the window.

With the default `n8n_execution_data_storage_mode = "database"` no
`execution_data/` objects exist, and a bucket-wide lifecycle rule for binary
data is unambiguously the right thing to add.

## Prometheus metrics

Set `n8n_metrics_enabled = true` to expose n8n's built-in Prometheus endpoint.
When on, the module appends `N8N_METRICS=true` to the main pod's `extraEnv`;
n8n serves metrics on its existing HTTP listener — path **`/metrics`** on
**port `5678`** (the same port and `n8n-main` Service the chart already
publishes for the UI/API), so no additional ports or Services are needed.

The pinned n8n Helm chart version (see `n8n_chart_version`) exposes no
top-level `metrics` or `serviceMonitor` block of its own — verified via
`helm show values oci://ghcr.io/n8n-io/n8n-helm-chart/n8n --version <ver>` —
so this toggle is intentionally env-var-only. Wiring the actual scrape is
left to your monitoring stack: add Prometheus scrape annotations to the
`n8n-main` Service via your own Kubernetes resource, or create a
`ServiceMonitor` CR if you run the Prometheus Operator.

## OpenTelemetry tracing

Set `n8n_otel_enabled = true` to turn on n8n's built-in workflow and node
tracing. The module wires the `N8N_OTEL_*` environment variables onto the
Helm release's `config.extraEnv` block, which the chart applies to **every**
n8n container — main, worker, and webhook processor. This matches the
queue-mode requirement in the
[n8n OpenTelemetry docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/opentelemetry/):
the env vars must be set on every instance for trace context to propagate
between them.

The **collector** (e.g. an OpenTelemetry Collector deployment, or Jaeger's
OTLP receiver) is intentionally **out of scope** for this module. Deploy
one separately — either with a sibling Terraform module, the upstream
`open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector` Helm chart, or your existing
observability platform — then point `n8n_otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint` at
its base URL (n8n appends `/v1/traces` itself, so don't include it).

Minimal opt-in:

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...other inputs...

  n8n_otel_enabled                = true
  n8n_otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint = "http://otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318"
}
```

Individual tuning variables (`n8n_otel_exporter_otlp_headers`,
`n8n_otel_exporter_service_name`, `n8n_otel_traces_sample_rate`,
`n8n_otel_traces_include_node_spans`, `n8n_otel_traces_inject_outbound`,
`n8n_otel_traces_production_only`) all default to `null`. When an individual value is `null` the corresponding
env var is omitted entirely and n8n's own default applies — only set the
values you actually need to override.

When `n8n_otel_enabled = false` (the default), none of the `N8N_OTEL_*`
env vars are emitted and n8n's OpenTelemetry SDK is not loaded.
`n8n_otel_exporter_otlp_headers` is marked `sensitive` because it typically
carries collector authentication tokens.

## Log streaming (Enterprise)

Set `n8n_log_streaming_managed_by_env = true` to provision n8n's
[log streaming](https://docs.n8n.io/log-streaming/) destinations
declaratively from Terraform instead of the UI. The module JSON-encodes
`n8n_log_streaming_destinations` into `N8N_LOG_STREAMING_DESTINATIONS` and
sets `N8N_LOG_STREAMING_MANAGED_BY_ENV=true` on every n8n container. n8n
then reapplies the destinations on **every startup** and locks the Log
Streaming UI controls read-only — Terraform becomes the source of truth.

Requires **n8n >= 2.19.0** and an Enterprise license that includes the log
streaming entitlement (the module already requires `n8n_license_key`).

```hcl
module "n8n" {
  # ...other inputs...

  n8n_log_streaming_managed_by_env = true
  n8n_log_streaming_destinations = [
    {
      type             = "webhook"
      label            = "Audit events"
      enabled          = true
      subscribedEvents = ["n8n.audit", "n8n.workflow"]
      url              = "https://hooks.example.com/n8n"
      method           = "POST"
    },
  ]
}
```

Each destination is an object with `type` set to `webhook`, `syslog`, or
`sentry` plus the type-specific fields from the
[n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/log-streaming/#configure-using-environment-variables).
The variable is marked `sensitive` (webhook headers and Sentry DSNs
typically carry credentials), but the rendered value still lands in
Terraform state and the pod environment in plaintext — restrict access
accordingly. Setting `n8n_log_streaming_managed_by_env` back to `false`
keeps the last applied destinations but restores UI write access.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------- | :------: |
| <a name="input_alb_inbound_cidrs"></a> [alb\_inbound\_cidrs](#input\_alb\_inbound\_cidrs) | IPv4 CIDR blocks allowed to reach the module-managed ALB, rendered into alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/inbound-cidrs. Empty (the default) omits the annotation, leaving the AWS Load Balancer Controller default of 0.0.0.0/0, so the ALB accepts connections from anywhere. IMPORTANT: the module-managed ALB serves the webhook path prefixes as well as the editor UI, and this restriction applies to the whole load balancer rather than per path, so it blocks inbound production webhooks from third-party senders (Slack, Stripe, GitHub, Telegram) as surely as it blocks a browser. Use it when nothing external needs to call in, or when every sender is on a known range. To lock down the editor while keeping webhooks public, run two load balancers instead: see examples/split-ingress. This narrows an internet-facing ALB; it is not the same as ingress\_scheme = "internal", which moves the ALB into private subnets and off public DNS. The restriction applies to every listen port, so port 80 (the HTTPS redirect) is filtered too. IPv4 only, matching the ALB this module builds: it leaves the controller's default ipv4 address type in place, so an IPv6 rule would never match a client. A dualstack ALB needs a VPC and subnets with IPv6 CIDRs, which the module does not create; set the whole allow-list on the annotation through ingress\_annotations if you run one. LBC ignores this annotation when alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups is set through ingress\_annotations, because the caller then owns the security group. An IngressClassParams setting spec.inboundCIDRs does replace this annotation rather than merging with it, but only for an Ingress the controller classifies through spec.ingressClassName; the module-managed Ingress also carries the legacy kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation, which the controller matches first, so a populated IngressClassParams cannot override this input. See docs/troubleshooting.md, which has the kubectl commands and covers the caller-owned Ingresses that are exposed. LBC also reverts hand-edits to the security group it manages, so widening the range back after locking yourself out is a terraform apply, not a console fix. Ignored when create\_ingress = false. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_alb_inbound_prefix_list_ids"></a> [alb\_inbound\_prefix\_list\_ids](#input\_alb\_inbound\_prefix\_list\_ids) | VPC managed prefix list IDs allowed to reach the module-managed ALB, rendered into alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-group-prefix-lists. Empty (the default) omits the annotation. Carries the same blast radius as alb\_inbound\_cidrs: the restriction covers the whole ALB, webhook paths included, so third-party webhook senders outside the lists stop reaching n8n. Preferred over alb\_inbound\_cidrs when the allowed ranges are already maintained as a prefix list, or shared across load balancers and security groups: the list is edited in one place and every reference follows, instead of re-applying this module for a range change. Combines with alb\_inbound\_cidrs, which is a union rather than an intersection. Mind the security group quota: a rule referencing a prefix list counts against the rules-per-security-group quota (default 60, quota code L-0EA8095F) by the list's max-entries weight rather than as one rule, once per listen port, and this ALB listens on 80 and 443, so everything counts twice. Keep 2 x (combined list weight + number of alb\_inbound\_cidrs entries) at or under the quota. A list too heavy to fit, and most AWS-managed lists are (the CloudFront origin-facing list weighs 55, needing 110 rules of the default 60 by itself), takes the ALB offline for every source instead of failing the apply: the controller revokes the existing rules first, then RulesPerSecurityGroupLimitExceeded stops it from authorizing the new ones, and the security group is left with no ingress rules at all, webhooks included, while terraform apply reports success. Verified live against LBC v3.5.0. Recovery is shrinking the lists (or raising the quota) and re-applying; see docs/troubleshooting.md. LBC ignores this annotation when alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups is set through ingress\_annotations. An IngressClassParams setting spec.prefixListsIDs replaces this annotation rather than merging with it, but cannot reach the module-managed Ingress, for the reason given on alb\_inbound\_cidrs; see docs/troubleshooting.md. Ignored when create\_ingress = false. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_alb_ssl_policy"></a> [alb\_ssl\_policy](#input\_alb\_ssl\_policy) | TLS negotiation policy for the ALB HTTPS listener, wired to alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy. Defaults to a current, modern policy (ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06) so the negotiated policy is explicit and pinned in Terraform rather than left to whatever the ALB defaults to, which AWS can change without notice. Set this to any AWS-published ELB security policy name (e.g. one of the `ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-*` or `ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-*` families) to match a compliance baseline such as TLS 1.2 minimum or TLS 1.3-only. Ignored when create\_ingress = false, or when ingress\_annotations sets alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy directly (last write wins; the module warns when that happens). | `string` | `"ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06"` | no |
| <a name="input_aws_region"></a> [aws\_region](#input\_aws\_region) | AWS region to deploy into (e.g. us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1). Must match the region the AWS provider is configured for. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_certificate_arn"></a> [certificate\_arn](#input\_certificate\_arn) | ARN of a pre-validated ACM certificate for n8n\_domain. Use this for Cloudflare, GoDaddy, or any DNS provider other than Route53 — the respective examples (examples/cloudflare, examples/godaddy) issue the certificate and pass its ARN here. Set exactly one of certificate\_arn or route53\_zone\_id. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_cluster_endpoint_private_access"></a> [cluster\_endpoint\_private\_access](#input\_cluster\_endpoint\_private\_access) | Whether the EKS API server endpoint is also reachable from inside the VPC. Defaults to false, matching the module's existing behavior. When false, in-VPC traffic (worker nodes' kubelet connections included) reaches the control plane over the public endpoint via NAT; when true, the endpoint resolves to private IPs inside the VPC and that traffic stays in the VPC. Set to true to keep kubectl working from inside the VPC/VPN while restricting or disabling public access. At least one of cluster\_endpoint\_public\_access or cluster\_endpoint\_private\_access must be true. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_cluster_endpoint_public_access"></a> [cluster\_endpoint\_public\_access](#input\_cluster\_endpoint\_public\_access) | Whether the EKS API server endpoint is reachable from outside the VPC. Defaults to true so kubectl works immediately after apply. Set to false (with cluster\_endpoint\_private\_access = true) to require VPN/peering/bastion access to the control plane. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_cluster_endpoint_public_access_cidrs"></a> [cluster\_endpoint\_public\_access\_cidrs](#input\_cluster\_endpoint\_public\_access\_cidrs) | CIDR blocks allowed to reach the EKS API server's public endpoint. Defaults to 0.0.0.0/0 (unrestricted) to preserve current behavior. Restrict to your office/VPN CIDRs to clear Checkov findings CKV\_AWS\_38/CKV\_AWS\_39 without disabling public access outright. Ignored when cluster\_endpoint\_public\_access = false. | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br/>  "0.0.0.0/0"<br/>]</pre> | no |
| <a name="input_cluster_name"></a> [cluster\_name](#input\_cluster\_name) | Name for the EKS cluster. Keep to 14 characters or fewer — the module derives an ElastiCache cluster ID of `<cluster_name>-redis`, and AWS caps ElastiCache IDs at 20 chars. | `string` | `"n8n-cluster"` | no |
| <a name="input_create_database"></a> [create\_database](#input\_create\_database) | When true (the default), the module creates and manages an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance. Set to false to use an external database (e.g. Amazon Aurora created by the caller) — db\_host and db\_password must then be supplied. Kept as a static boolean rather than `db_host == null` because count expressions cannot depend on values computed at apply time. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_create_elasticache"></a> [create\_elasticache](#input\_create\_elasticache) | When true (the default), the module creates and manages the ElastiCache Redis that the Bull queue and multi-main leader election run on. Set to false to point n8n at an external Redis. redis\_host must then be supplied, and the module creates no ElastiCache cluster, replication group, subnet group, or security group. Mirrors create\_database, and is the hook the cross-region HA/DR design uses to share one replication-capable Redis between regions. Kept as a static boolean rather than `redis_host == null` because count expressions cannot depend on values computed at apply time. The module wires host and port only: an external Redis that requires AUTH or TLS is not supported yet. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_create_ingress"></a> [create\_ingress](#input\_create\_ingress) | When true (the default), the module creates the ALB Ingress that fronts n8n: a single internet-facing ALB routing /webhook to the webhook processors and / to the mains. Set to false to bring your own Ingress resources, for example the two-ALB split where an internet-facing ALB serves /webhook and a separate internal (VPN-only) ALB serves the admin UI. When false the module also skips the Route 53 alias A-record and the ALB lookup behind it, since there is no module-owned ALB to point at; the ACM certificate is still issued when route53\_zone\_id is set. Point your own Ingresses at the module-created Services n8n\_service\_name and n8n\_webhook\_service\_name, both on port 5678. Kept as a static boolean because count expressions cannot depend on values computed at apply time. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_db_allocated_storage"></a> [db\_allocated\_storage](#input\_db\_allocated\_storage) | Allocated storage for RDS in GB | `number` | `50` | no |
| <a name="input_db_allowed_cidr_blocks"></a> [db\_allowed\_cidr\_blocks](#input\_db\_allowed\_cidr\_blocks) | Additional CIDR blocks allowed to reach the module-managed RDS instance on port 5432, appended to the VPC CIDR (which is always allowed so nodes and pods can connect). Use this for a corporate network, VPN pool, or peered VPC rather than attaching a standalone aws\_security\_group\_rule at the root, because a root-level rule is not tracked by the module's inline ingress block and gets stripped on the next plan. Duplicates, including a repeat of the VPC CIDR, are collapsed. With create\_database = false the security group is still created and carries these rules, but nothing is attached to it. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_db_allowed_security_group_ids"></a> [db\_allowed\_security\_group\_ids](#input\_db\_allowed\_security\_group\_ids) | Security group IDs allowed to reach the module-managed RDS instance on port 5432, in addition to the always-allowed VPC CIDR. Preferred over db\_allowed\_cidr\_blocks for sources inside the VPC: membership follows the instances rather than their addresses, so the rule survives subnet changes and IP reuse. Use it for a bastion, a migration runner, or an app tier that already has its own group. No rule is created when the list is empty. With create\_database = false the security group is still created and carries this rule, but nothing is attached to it. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_db_backup_retention_period"></a> [db\_backup\_retention\_period](#input\_db\_backup\_retention\_period) | Number of days to retain automated RDS backups. 0 disables automated backups (not recommended, and it also disables point-in-time recovery). AWS allows up to 35 days. Ignored when create\_database = false. | `number` | `7` | no |
| <a name="input_db_engine_version"></a> [db\_engine\_version](#input\_db\_engine\_version) | PostgreSQL engine version for the RDS instance. Must be a version available from `aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine postgres` in the target region — RDS deprecates and removes minor versions over time, and supported versions vary by region. Bump as needed without forking. | `string` | `"18.4"` | no |
| <a name="input_db_host"></a> [db\_host](#input\_db\_host) | External database host. Required when create\_database = false. Ignored otherwise. Use this to pass in an Amazon Aurora cluster endpoint or any external PostgreSQL host. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_db_instance_class"></a> [db\_instance\_class](#input\_db\_instance\_class) | RDS instance class (db.t3.small ~$25/month, db.t3.medium for higher load) | `string` | `"db.t3.small"` | no |
| <a name="input_db_multi_az"></a> [db\_multi\_az](#input\_db\_multi\_az) | Deploy RDS in Multi-AZ mode for automatic failover (recommended for production) | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_db_password"></a> [db\_password](#input\_db\_password) | Password for the external database specified by db\_host. Required when create\_database = false. Ignored otherwise (the module generates a random password for its managed RDS instance). | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_db_postgresdb_pool_size"></a> [db\_postgresdb\_pool\_size](#input\_db\_postgresdb\_pool\_size) | Number of TypeORM connection pool slots per n8n pod. Each pod holds this many persistent PostgreSQL connections. Rule of thumb: pool\_size >= worker\_concurrency / 4. With PgBouncer in transaction mode a lower value (5) is sufficient; without PgBouncer use a value matching concurrency (10-20). | `number` | `10` | no |
| <a name="input_db_postgresdb_ssl_enabled"></a> [db\_postgresdb\_ssl\_enabled](#input\_db\_postgresdb\_ssl\_enabled) | Whether n8n connects to the database over SSL. Set to true (the default) for direct connections to RDS or Aurora — they use the AWS CA which Node.js doesn't trust by default, so the connection still negotiates SSL but skips certificate verification. Set to false when n8n connects to an in-cluster connection pooler (e.g. PgBouncer) that handles SSL on its upstream leg — the pod-to-pod traffic stays inside the cluster network. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_db_query_logging_enabled"></a> [db\_query\_logging\_enabled](#input\_db\_query\_logging\_enabled) | Create and attach a custom RDS parameter group that logs DDL and queries slower than 1 second and enforces rds.force\_ssl = 1. Defaults to false to preserve upgrade compatibility: aws\_db\_instance.n8n ignores engine\_version drift, so an existing instance may still run an older PostgreSQL major than db\_engine\_version, and RDS rejects a parameter group from the wrong major family. Enable this for a new deployment, or only after confirming the live instance major matches db\_engine\_version. Changing the attached parameter group takes effect on reboot. Ignored when create\_database = false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_db_storage_encrypted"></a> [db\_storage\_encrypted](#input\_db\_storage\_encrypted) | When true (the default), encrypt the RDS instance's storage, Performance Insights data, and the postgresql CloudWatch log group with a module-created Customer Managed KMS Key (aws\_kms\_key.db). Clears Checkov findings CKV\_AWS\_16, CKV\_AWS\_354, and CKV\_AWS\_158. Flipping this from false to true on an existing RDS instance forces a replacement — AWS does not support enabling storage encryption in place, so the upgrade path is snapshot → restore into a new encrypted instance. Set to false in your tfvars to preserve current behavior on pre-existing unencrypted deployments. The CMK rotates annually and uses a 7-day deletion window (AWS minimum). Ignored when create\_database = false. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_eks_secrets_encryption_enabled"></a> [eks\_secrets\_encryption\_enabled](#input\_eks\_secrets\_encryption\_enabled) | When true (the default), envelope-encrypt Kubernetes Secrets and the EKS control-plane CloudWatch log group with a module-created Customer Managed KMS Key (aws\_kms\_key.eks). Clears Checkov findings CKV\_AWS\_58 and CKV\_AWS\_158. The supported AWS provider associates encryption with an existing unencrypted cluster in place; disabling it again is irreversible in EKS and therefore forces cluster replacement. Set to false before the first apply to preserve current behavior on a pre-existing cluster without secrets encryption. The CMK rotates annually and uses a 7-day deletion window (AWS minimum). | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_ingress_annotations"></a> [ingress\_annotations](#input\_ingress\_annotations) | Extra annotations for the module-managed Ingress, merged over the module's defaults (last write wins). Use this for AWS Load Balancer Controller features the module has no opinion on: alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/wafv2-acl-arn, subnets, security-groups, load-balancer-name, group.name, access log settings. Overriding alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes drops the session stickiness that keeps WebSocket connections pinned to one main pod; re-include stickiness.enabled=true if you set it. Prefer ingress\_scheme over setting alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme here, alb\_ssl\_policy over setting alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy here, and alb\_inbound\_cidrs / alb\_inbound\_prefix\_list\_ids over setting alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/inbound-cidrs or security-group-prefix-lists here, because setting both raises a plan-time warning. Ignored when create\_ingress = false. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| <a name="input_ingress_scheme"></a> [ingress\_scheme](#input\_ingress\_scheme) | ALB scheme for the module-managed Ingress: internet-facing (the default) or internal. Use internal to keep n8n reachable only from within the VPC and any peered/VPN networks. Ignored when create\_ingress = false. An internal scheme makes the Route 53 alias record resolve to private addresses, which is the intended behavior for a private deployment. | `string` | `"internet-facing"` | no |
| <a name="input_kubernetes_version"></a> [kubernetes\_version](#input\_kubernetes\_version) | Kubernetes version for the EKS cluster | `string` | `"1.35"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_additional_domains"></a> [n8n\_additional\_domains](#input\_n8n\_additional\_domains) | Extra fully-qualified hostnames n8n should answer on, beyond n8n\_domain. Added to the module-issued ACM certificate as subject alternative names and given a Route 53 validation record each. Requires the Route 53 path (route53\_zone\_id set); with a caller-supplied certificate\_arn the module cannot add names to a certificate it did not issue, and a plan-time warning says so. With create\_ingress = true each name also gets an alias A-record and an Ingress rule, so the module routes it end to end. With create\_ingress = false the certificate still covers every name and every name is still validated: consume it through the certificate\_arn output and attach it to your own Ingress resources, as examples/split-ingress does. n8n\_domain stays canonical: it is what n8n advertises as WEBHOOK\_URL and N8N\_HOST. Every name must live in the hosted zone given by route53\_zone\_id, since that is the zone all validation and alias records are written to. A name outside it fails the apply when Route 53 rejects the record as not permitted in the zone. Names in a second hosted zone need their own certificate and records, which the caller owns. Names are normalized to lowercase before use: ACM and Kubernetes both store them that way, and DNS is case-insensitive. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_chart_version"></a> [n8n\_chart\_version](#input\_n8n\_chart\_version) | n8n Helm chart version to deploy | `string` | `"1.10.0"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_community_packages_prevent_loading"></a> [n8n\_community\_packages\_prevent\_loading](#input\_n8n\_community\_packages\_prevent\_loading) | Prevent installed community packages from being loaded at runtime. Maps to N8N\_COMMUNITY\_PACKAGES\_PREVENT\_LOADING. When true, n8n leaves the community-packages management surface in place but skips loading the package code, which is useful for locking an instance down without uninstalling. Leave false (the default) for community nodes to load and execute. n8n defaults this to false; when false the env var is omitted entirely so n8n's own default applies. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_community_packages_registry"></a> [n8n\_community\_packages\_registry](#input\_n8n\_community\_packages\_registry) | npm registry community packages are installed from (e.g. <https://npm.internal.example.com>). Maps to N8N\_COMMUNITY\_PACKAGES\_REGISTRY, which n8n gates behind a specific licensed feature rather than a license key alone: any value other than <https://registry.npmjs.org> makes installs throw FeatureNotLicensedError unless the instance is entitled to COMMUNITY\_NODES\_CUSTOM\_REGISTRY (`getNpmRegistry` in community-packages.service.ts). Confirm that entitlement before setting this, since an unentitled instance breaks community-package installs instead of falling back to the public registry. Point this at a private mirror to install community nodes from an internal registry instead of the public npm one, e.g. when egress to registry.npmjs.org is blocked or packages are vendored. n8n defaults to <https://registry.npmjs.org>; when this is null (the default) the env var is omitted entirely so n8n's own default applies. A mirror that requires authentication also needs N8N\_COMMUNITY\_PACKAGES\_AUTH\_TOKEN, which this module does not manage; pass it via n8n\_extra\_env, keeping in mind that n8n\_extra\_env values are stored in plaintext in the Helm release and Terraform state. Baking packages into a custom image via n8n\_image\_repository avoids registry access at pod start entirely. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_custom_extensions_path"></a> [n8n\_custom\_extensions\_path](#input\_n8n\_custom\_extensions\_path) | Absolute path inside the n8n container that n8n scans for custom nodes at startup (e.g. "/opt/n8n-nodes"). Maps to N8N\_CUSTOM\_EXTENSIONS, and is set on every pod type (main, worker, webhook processor). This is the supported way to ship nodes baked into a custom image: since n8n 1.0 the loader no longer picks up nodes from the image's global node\_modules, so a plain npm install into the image is never seen (n8n v10 migration guide, and packages/cli/src/load-nodes-and-credentials.ts). Something has to put files at this path, so either set n8n\_image\_repository to an image that baked them in, or mount a volume that carries them with n8n\_extra\_volumes and n8n\_extra\_volume\_mounts; a path with neither behind it warns at plan time. The path must be outside /home/node/.n8n, which the chart mounts over on main pods (see the validation below). Two caveats that no Terraform input can fix. First, nodes loaded this way are registered under the package name CUSTOM, so a node whose type was n8n-nodes-example.myNode when installed from npm becomes CUSTOM.myNode, and existing workflows referencing the npm-qualified type will not resolve. Second, only one directory is exposed even though n8n accepts a semicolon-separated list, because every custom directory is registered under the same CUSTOM key and each one overwrites the last, so all but the final directory are silently dropped. Leave null (the default) to omit the env var entirely. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_domain"></a> [n8n\_domain](#input\_n8n\_domain) | Fully-qualified domain name for n8n (e.g. n8n.example.com). Must match the CN / SAN on the certificate provided via certificate\_arn. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_n8n_execution_concurrency_limit"></a> [n8n\_execution\_concurrency\_limit](#input\_n8n\_execution\_concurrency\_limit) | Maximum concurrent production executions (-1 to disable) | `number` | `100` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_execution_data_storage_mode"></a> [n8n\_execution\_data\_storage\_mode](#input\_n8n\_execution\_data\_storage\_mode) | Where n8n stores the data of each new execution. Maps to N8N\_EXECUTION\_DATA\_STORAGE\_MODE. "database" (the default) keeps execution data in PostgreSQL, matching n8n's own default, and emits no env var. "s3" offloads it to the module's S3 bucket, reusing the same bucket and N8N\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE\_S3\_* connection that binary data mode already uses, so no extra bucket, IAM policy, or credentials are needed. Execution-data writes are usually the dominant write load on the n8n database at volume, so s3 is the main lever for relieving RDS pressure. Requires n8n >= 2.27 (pin n8n\_image\_tag accordingly) and an Enterprise license carrying the feat:executionDataS3 entitlement, which is a different entitlement from the feat:binaryDataS3 one the always-on binary data offload uses: n8n refuses to start in s3 mode without it. There is no backfill: existing executions stay readable where they were written, and only new executions go to S3, under workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/execution\_data/bundle.json. n8n prunes those objects itself as part of the executions hard-delete path (see n8n\_pruning\_max\_age / n8n\_pruning\_max\_count), so do NOT add an S3 lifecycle rule that can reach execution\_data/ objects (see the S3 lifecycle section in the README). Note the durability trade-off: RDS gets automated backups and point-in-time recovery (db\_backup\_retention\_period, default 7 days) while the bucket has no versioning, no backups, and force\_destroy = true, so in s3 mode a terraform destroy takes execution history with it. See the durability section in the README. "filesystem" is deliberately not accepted: pod filesystems are ephemeral and unshared in this module's queue-mode topology, so execution data written there would be lost on reschedule and invisible to the other pods. See <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/scaling/use-external-storage>. | `string` | `"database"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_execution_timeout"></a> [n8n\_execution\_timeout](#input\_n8n\_execution\_timeout) | Default execution timeout in seconds (-1 to disable) | `number` | `7200` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_execution_timeout_max"></a> [n8n\_execution\_timeout\_max](#input\_n8n\_execution\_timeout\_max) | Maximum execution timeout users can configure in seconds | `number` | `7200` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_extra_env"></a> [n8n\_extra\_env](#input\_n8n\_extra\_env) | Additional environment variables to inject into all n8n pods (main, worker, and webhook-processor) via the Helm chart's config.extraEnv list. Each entry is an object with name and value string attributes. config.extraEnv is appended last in every container's env list, so by Kubernetes' last-wins rule any name here overrides the chart's value for that name. To prevent silently breaking the deployment, an entry is rejected at plan time when its name collides with a connection, identity, storage, license, or topology variable the module manages: any name starting with DB\_, QUEUE\_, N8N\_RUNNERS\_, N8N\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE\_S3\_, N8N\_MULTI\_MAIN\_, or AWS\_, plus names like N8N\_ENCRYPTION\_KEY, N8N\_LICENSE\_ACTIVATION\_KEY, N8N\_HOST, WEBHOOK\_URL, and EXECUTIONS\_MODE. Use the dedicated module inputs for those. Do not put secret values here, because they render into the Helm release and are stored in plaintext in Terraform state; instead pass a *\_FILE companion (e.g. a name ending in \_FILE) pointing at a mounted Kubernetes secret, or use n8n credentials. Example: [{name = "N8N\_DEFAULT\_LOCALE", value = "de"}]. | <pre>list(object({<br/>    name  = string<br/>    value = string<br/>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_extra_volume_mounts"></a> [n8n\_extra\_volume\_mounts](#input\_n8n\_extra\_volume\_mounts) | Where the n8n container mounts the volumes declared in n8n\_extra\_volumes, mapped to the chart's extraVolumeMounts. Applies to the main, worker and webhook-processor pods alike, and to the n8n container only, not the task runner sidecar. Every name here must match a name in n8n\_extra\_volumes, which is checked at plan time rather than left to fail at pod start. read\_only defaults to true, so a mount that has to be written needs to say so. Use this with n8n\_custom\_extensions\_path to load community nodes from a volume rather than from a custom image; when a mount covers that path, the module stops warning that the path has nothing behind it. | <pre>list(object({<br/>    name       = string<br/>    mount_path = string<br/>    sub_path   = optional(string)<br/>    read_only  = optional(bool, true)<br/>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_extra_volumes"></a> [n8n\_extra\_volumes](#input\_n8n\_extra\_volumes) | Volumes to add to the main, worker and webhook-processor pods, mapped to the chart's extraVolumes. Each entry needs a name and exactly one source: config\_map, secret, or persistent\_volume\_claim. Those three are the sources that can carry files into a pod on their own, which is the point of the input: paired with n8n\_extra\_volume\_mounts and n8n\_custom\_extensions\_path, they load community nodes from a ConfigMap or a shared ReadWriteMany claim instead of from a custom image, which is the alternative to rebuilding an image for every package change. Other uses fit too, a CA bundle from a secret being the common one. default\_mode is an octal string ("0644"), not a number, because Terraform reads a leading zero as decimal and would silently apply the wrong permissions. Volume sources beyond those three (csi, nfs, projected) are not exposed. Names must be unique, and "data" and "task-runner-config" are reserved by the chart. | <pre>list(object({<br/>    name = string<br/>    config_map = optional(object({<br/>      name         = string<br/>      default_mode = optional(string)<br/>    }))<br/>    secret = optional(object({<br/>      secret_name  = string<br/>      default_mode = optional(string)<br/>    }))<br/>    persistent_volume_claim = optional(object({<br/>      claim_name = string<br/>      read_only  = optional(bool)<br/>    }))<br/>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_helm_timeout"></a> [n8n\_helm\_timeout](#input\_n8n\_helm\_timeout) | Seconds Terraform waits for the n8n Helm release to converge. Increase for large deployments where rolling out 50+ pods (workers + webhook processors + main) exceeds the default. 600s is fine for the default/medium examples; large deployments at 250+ pods need ~1800s. | `number` | `600` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_image_pull_secrets"></a> [n8n\_image\_pull\_secrets](#input\_n8n\_image\_pull\_secrets) | Names of existing Kubernetes secrets of type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson, in var.namespace, that the n8n pods authenticate to their image registry with. Leave empty (the default) for a public registry or an ECR repository in this account, which the node group's IAM role already pulls without credentials. Setting this changes who owns the ServiceAccount: the pinned chart renders imagePullSecrets nowhere, so the module creates the account itself, attaches these secrets to it, and passes serviceAccount.create = false, an arrangement the chart documents and supports. The module's account takes a different name from the chart's, so that turning this on for a deployment that already exists does not collide with the account Helm still owns; the S3 Pod Identity association follows whichever name is in play, so it keeps working either way. Creating and rotating the secrets stays the caller's job, because a dockerconfigjson generated here would sit in plaintext in Terraform state; kubectl create secret docker-registry, or an operator like External Secrets, are the usual routes. This is also the wrong tool for cross-account ECR, whose authorization tokens expire after 12 hours: add the node group role to the source registry's repository policy instead and leave this empty. The node\_group\_role\_arn output is the principal to name in that policy. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_image_repository"></a> [n8n\_image\_repository](#input\_n8n\_image\_repository) | Container image repository for the n8n application, without a tag (e.g. "123456789012.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/n8n"). When it is null (the default), the Helm chart's own repository applies (currently `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n`). Point this at a custom image built from the n8n base image to bake community packages into the image itself, which removes the boot-time npm install that n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages performs on every pod start. Set the tag through n8n\_image\_tag, not here. Two things come with a custom image: the image has to be pullable, which a public registry or an ECR repository in this account already is, while any other private registry needs its credentials listed in n8n\_image\_pull\_secrets (cross-account ECR is the exception, and is better served by naming the node\_group\_role\_arn output in the source repository's policy); and when the tag is not a published n8n version, also set n8n\_task\_runner\_image\_tag, because the chart derives the task runner sidecar's tag from this image's tag. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_image_tag"></a> [n8n\_image\_tag](#input\_n8n\_image\_tag) | n8n application image tag to deploy (e.g. "2.27.4"). When it is null (the default), the Helm chart's own default applies — currently the floating `stable` tag, which resolves to whatever n8n version is latest at the time each pod starts. Pin this to a concrete version for reproducible, incremental upgrades and to avoid crossing major-version boundaries (e.g. the n8n 2.0 breaking changes) on an unplanned pod reschedule. See <https://docs.n8n.io/2-0-breaking-changes/> for the n8n 2.x migration guide. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_license_detach_floating_on_shutdown"></a> [n8n\_license\_detach\_floating\_on\_shutdown](#input\_n8n\_license\_detach\_floating\_on\_shutdown) | Whether n8n main pods detach their floating license entitlement on shutdown. Maps to N8N\_LICENSE\_DETACH\_FLOATING\_ON\_SHUTDOWN. n8n's upstream default is true, which is safe for a single main but breaks multi-main (n8n\_main\_hpa\_min\_replicas > 1, the module default): the leader main detaches on shutdown and zeroes the shared floating cert in the database, so any fresh main pod that starts as a follower reads the zeroed cert, fails the init-time license gate, and crash-loops — which can push a Helm release with atomic = true into a stuck pending-rollback state (see docs/troubleshooting.md and <https://github.com/n8n-io/terraform-aws-n8n/issues/49>). The module defaults this to false, overriding n8n's own default, because all mains share the same device fingerprint: a single floating seat is reused across restarts and nothing leaks. Set to true only to restore n8n's upstream behavior, and only for single-main deployments. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_license_key"></a> [n8n\_license\_key](#input\_n8n\_license\_key) | n8n Enterprise license activation key. Get one at <https://n8n.io/pricing> | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_n8n_log_level"></a> [n8n\_log\_level](#input\_n8n\_log\_level) | n8n log level. Maps to the N8N\_LOG\_LEVEL environment variable. One of: silent, error, warn, info, debug, verbose. | `string` | `"info"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_log_output"></a> [n8n\_log\_output](#input\_n8n\_log\_output) | n8n log output destination(s). Maps to the N8N\_LOG\_OUTPUT environment variable. Comma-separated subset of: console, file (e.g. "console", "file", "console,file"). Note: this variable does NOT control log *format* — setting an invalid value (e.g. "json") leaves Winston with no transport and silently drops all logs. To emit JSON-formatted logs, configure n8n's logging block separately; this env var only selects destinations. | `string` | `"console"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_log_streaming_destinations"></a> [n8n\_log\_streaming\_destinations](#input\_n8n\_log\_streaming\_destinations) | List of log streaming destination objects, JSON-encoded into N8N\_LOG\_STREAMING\_DESTINATIONS. Each entry must set type to webhook, syslog, or sentry, plus the type-specific fields documented at <https://docs.n8n.io/log-streaming/#configure-using-environment-variables> (common fields: label, enabled, subscribedEvents, anonymizeAuditMessages, circuitBreaker). Typed as any because the three destination shapes differ structurally. Marked sensitive because webhook headers and Sentry DSNs typically carry credentials — note the value is still injected as a literal env var: it is persisted in plaintext in Terraform state and visible in the pod environment (kubectl describe / printenv). Ignored when n8n\_log\_streaming\_managed\_by\_env = false. | `any` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_log_streaming_managed_by_env"></a> [n8n\_log\_streaming\_managed\_by\_env](#input\_n8n\_log\_streaming\_managed\_by\_env) | Manage n8n's Enterprise log streaming destinations from environment variables instead of the UI. Maps to N8N\_LOG\_STREAMING\_MANAGED\_BY\_ENV. When true, n8n applies n8n\_log\_streaming\_destinations on every startup and locks the Log Streaming UI controls read-only. When false (the default), no log streaming env vars are emitted and destinations stay UI-managed; flipping back to false keeps the last applied destinations but restores UI write access. Requires n8n >= 2.19.0 and an Enterprise license that includes log streaming. See <https://docs.n8n.io/log-streaming/> for the underlying n8n contract. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_cpu_limit"></a> [n8n\_main\_cpu\_limit](#input\_n8n\_main\_cpu\_limit) | CPU limit for n8n main pods (e.g. 2000m, 1000m) | `string` | `"2000m"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_cpu_request"></a> [n8n\_main\_cpu\_request](#input\_n8n\_main\_cpu\_request) | CPU request for n8n main pods (e.g. 1000m, 500m) | `string` | `"1000m"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_hpa_cpu_threshold"></a> [n8n\_main\_hpa\_cpu\_threshold](#input\_n8n\_main\_hpa\_cpu\_threshold) | Target average CPU utilization (%) that triggers scaling of n8n main pods. | `number` | `60` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_hpa_max_replicas"></a> [n8n\_main\_hpa\_max\_replicas](#input\_n8n\_main\_hpa\_max\_replicas) | Maximum replicas for n8n main pods. HPA will not scale above this. The default of 6 is sized to the default node group (node\_max × node\_instance\_type): at the default CPU requests, 6 main pods plus their task runner sidecars, the worker ceiling, and the webhook ceiling all fit in what 6 t3.xlarge nodes can schedule. Raise this together with node\_max or node\_instance\_type. An HPA ceiling the node group cannot hold leaves pods Pending with "Insufficient cpu" once the Cluster Autoscaler reaches node\_max, which also slows rollouts. The module warns at plan time when the three groups are out of step; see README.md → "Sizing autoscaling against node capacity". | `number` | `6` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_hpa_min_replicas"></a> [n8n\_main\_hpa\_min\_replicas](#input\_n8n\_main\_hpa\_min\_replicas) | Minimum replicas for n8n main pods. HPA will not scale below this. Also becomes the deployment's own replica count: the Helm chart renders spec.replicas unconditionally, so leaving it below the autoscaler floor would make every helm upgrade scale down and then wait for the autoscaler to climb back. Keep at 2 or more for availability: mains serve the editor and REST API, and the module's PodDisruptionBudget only guarantees one during a node drain. | `number` | `2` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_memory_limit"></a> [n8n\_main\_memory\_limit](#input\_n8n\_main\_memory\_limit) | Memory limit for n8n main pods (e.g. 4Gi, 2Gi) | `string` | `"4Gi"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_main_memory_request"></a> [n8n\_main\_memory\_request](#input\_n8n\_main\_memory\_request) | Memory request for n8n main pods (e.g. 2Gi, 1Gi) | `string` | `"2Gi"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_metrics_enabled"></a> [n8n\_metrics\_enabled](#input\_n8n\_metrics\_enabled) | Enable n8n's built-in Prometheus metrics endpoint. When true, the module appends N8N\_METRICS=true to the n8n Helm release's config.extraEnv, which the chart applies to every n8n container (main, worker, webhook processor). n8n exposes /metrics on its existing HTTP port (5678) — the same port and service the chart already publishes for the UI/API. The n8n Helm chart at the currently pinned version (see n8n\_chart\_version) exposes no top-level metrics / serviceMonitor block of its own, so this toggle is intentionally env-var-only. Scrape configuration (Prometheus scrape annotations or a ServiceMonitor CR) is left to the caller's monitoring stack — in practice the main pod's Service is the meaningful scrape target. Defaults to false; when false the env var is omitted entirely so n8n's own defaults apply. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_enabled"></a> [n8n\_otel\_enabled](#input\_n8n\_otel\_enabled) | Master switch for n8n's OpenTelemetry workflow + node tracing. When true, the module sets N8N\_OTEL\_ENABLED=true on all n8n containers (main, worker, webhook processor) via the Helm release's config.extraEnv block. When false (the default), no OpenTelemetry env vars are emitted and the SDK is not loaded. The OpenTelemetry collector / Jaeger receiver is out of scope for this module — deploy it separately and point n8n\_otel\_exporter\_otlp\_endpoint at it. See <https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/opentelemetry/> for the underlying n8n contract. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint"></a> [n8n\_otel\_exporter\_otlp\_endpoint](#input\_n8n\_otel\_exporter\_otlp\_endpoint) | Base URL of the OTLP HTTP endpoint to export traces to (e.g. <http://otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318> for an in-cluster collector). When set, maps to N8N\_OTEL\_EXPORTER\_OTLP\_ENDPOINT. n8n appends /v1/traces to this value internally, so point at the base URL, not the traces path. Leave null to use n8n's default (<http://localhost:4318>), which only works if a sidecar collector is colocated in each n8n pod (this module does not deploy one). Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_exporter_otlp_headers"></a> [n8n\_otel\_exporter\_otlp\_headers](#input\_n8n\_otel\_exporter\_otlp\_headers) | Comma-separated list of key=value pairs sent as HTTP headers with each OTLP request (e.g. `authorization=Bearer <token>,x-tenant=acme`). Use this for collector authentication or multi-tenant routing. Maps to N8N\_OTEL\_EXPORTER\_OTLP\_HEADERS. Leave null to send no extra headers. Marked sensitive so the value is redacted from CLI and plan output, but note it is still injected as a literal env var: it is persisted in plaintext in Terraform state and visible in the pod environment (kubectl describe / printenv). The chart's config.extraEnv does not support secretKeyRef, so restrict access to state and the n8n namespace accordingly. Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_exporter_service_name"></a> [n8n\_otel\_exporter\_service\_name](#input\_n8n\_otel\_exporter\_service\_name) | Value of the service.name resource attribute on exported spans. Maps to N8N\_OTEL\_EXPORTER\_SERVICE\_NAME. Leave null to use n8n's default ('n8n'). Set this to differentiate multiple n8n deployments sending traces to the same collector (e.g. 'n8n-prod', 'n8n-staging'). Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_traces_include_node_spans"></a> [n8n\_otel\_traces\_include\_node\_spans](#input\_n8n\_otel\_traces\_include\_node\_spans) | Whether to emit a node.execute span for each node execution. Maps to N8N\_OTEL\_TRACES\_INCLUDE\_NODE\_SPANS. Leave null to use n8n's default (true — one span per node per execution). Set to false to export workflow-level spans only — a common volume-reduction lever for workflows with many small nodes. Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_traces_inject_outbound"></a> [n8n\_otel\_traces\_inject\_outbound](#input\_n8n\_otel\_traces\_inject\_outbound) | Whether n8n's HTTP-helper-based nodes (HTTP Request and similar) inject W3C traceparent / tracestate headers into outbound requests. Maps to N8N\_OTEL\_TRACES\_INJECT\_OUTBOUND. Leave null to use n8n's default (true — propagate context to downstream services). Set to false when calling external systems that misbehave on unexpected headers, or when you don't want trace context leaving your boundary. Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_traces_production_only"></a> [n8n\_otel\_traces\_production\_only](#input\_n8n\_otel\_traces\_production\_only) | Whether to export traces for production workflow executions only. Maps to N8N\_OTEL\_TRACES\_PRODUCTION\_ONLY. Leave null to use n8n's default (true — only production executions are traced). Set to false to also trace manual/test executions run from the editor, which helps while developing instrumentation but is noisy in production. Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `bool` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_otel_traces_sample_rate"></a> [n8n\_otel\_traces\_sample\_rate](#input\_n8n\_otel\_traces\_sample\_rate) | Fraction of traces to export, between 0 and 1 inclusive. Maps to N8N\_OTEL\_TRACES\_SAMPLE\_RATE. n8n uses a trace-ID-ratio sampler, so the same trace ID is either fully sampled or fully dropped across all spans. Leave null to use n8n's default (1.0 — every trace exported). Lower for high-volume installs where the collector or backend can't handle every workflow execution as a trace. Ignored when n8n\_otel\_enabled = false. | `number` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_personalization_enabled"></a> [n8n\_personalization\_enabled](#input\_n8n\_personalization\_enabled) | Whether n8n asks users personalization survey questions and tailors content/recommendations based on the answers. Maps to N8N\_PERSONALIZATION\_ENABLED. When false, sets N8N\_PERSONALIZATION\_ENABLED=false on all n8n pods (main, worker, webhook processor) via config.extraEnv. Defaults to true, matching n8n's own default — note that explicitly setting true emits no env var (n8n's default already applies). Set to false to skip the personalization survey, e.g. on shared or ephemeral instances. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_prestop_sleep"></a> [n8n\_prestop\_sleep](#input\_n8n\_prestop\_sleep) | Seconds the preStop hook sleeps before SIGTERM is sent, giving the load balancer time to drain the pod. MINIMUM — do not lower below 10. | `number` | `10` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_pruning_max_age"></a> [n8n\_pruning\_max\_age](#input\_n8n\_pruning\_max\_age) | Maximum age of execution records to retain, in hours (336 = 14 days) | `number` | `336` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_pruning_max_count"></a> [n8n\_pruning\_max\_count](#input\_n8n\_pruning\_max\_count) | Maximum number of execution records to retain (0 = no limit) | `number` | `10000` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_redis_timeout_threshold"></a> [n8n\_redis\_timeout\_threshold](#input\_n8n\_redis\_timeout\_threshold) | Milliseconds n8n will keep trying to reach Redis before it gives up and exits the process, wired to QUEUE\_BULL\_REDIS\_TIMEOUT\_THRESHOLD. Leave null (the default) to use the chart's 10000, which is n8n's own default and what every existing deployment already runs. Raise it when redis\_high\_availability\_enabled = true and you would rather n8n rode a failover out than restarted: with the default, an ElastiCache promotion outlasts the budget and every main, worker and webhook pod exits and is restarted by Kubernetes. Pick the value deliberately, because the budget is coarser than it looks. n8n does not set ioredis's connectTimeout, so it stays at 10s, and a connect to a demoted primary hangs for that full 10s before failing. Each failed attempt therefore spends about 11.1s of this budget, making the effective values 11.1s, 33.2s and 66.4s for settings of 10s, 30s and 60s. 30000 was measured failing by 1.1 seconds against a 25 second outage; 60000 survived every case measured. 60000 is also confirmed against a real ElastiCache failover, where no container terminated and the endpoint stayed stale for 48 seconds, leaving about 20 seconds of headroom. That is one observed failover, so treat it as a good default rather than a guarantee. See README → "Surviving a Redis failover without restarting" for the measurements. | `number` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_reinstall_missing_packages"></a> [n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages](#input\_n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages) | Reinstall community packages that are recorded in the database but missing from a pod's local filesystem at startup. Maps to N8N\_REINSTALL\_MISSING\_PACKAGES. n8n stores installed community packages on the pod's filesystem, which is ephemeral in EKS, so a rescheduled or newly scaled-up worker comes up without them and nodes installed via the UI fail to load on that pod. Enabling this makes every pod (main, worker, and webhook-processor) reinstall the recorded packages on boot, which is what lets community nodes work reliably in queue mode. n8n defaults this to false; when false the env var is omitted entirely so n8n's own default applies. When true, size the webhook processor above this module's defaults: every pod runs npm installs at boot and n8n rebroadcasts installs to all pods via pubsub, so a rolling restart makes every webhook pod install repeatedly at once. Against low CPU/memory this causes CPU-based HPA thrash and OOMKilled crash loops; see n8n\_webhook\_cpu\_request, n8n\_webhook\_memory\_limit, and docs/troubleshooting.md. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_task_runner_auto_shutdown_timeout"></a> [n8n\_task\_runner\_auto\_shutdown\_timeout](#input\_n8n\_task\_runner\_auto\_shutdown\_timeout) | Seconds of inactivity before the runner process shuts down. Set to 0 to disable. | `number` | `15` | no |

| <a name="input_n8n_task_runner_image_tag"></a> [n8n\_task\_runner\_image\_tag](#input\_n8n\_task\_runner\_image\_tag) | Image tag for the task runner sidecar (`n8nio/runners`). When it is null (the default), the chart falls back to the n8n application image's tag, which is the right behavior as long as that tag is a published n8n version. Set this to the underlying n8n version when running a custom application image whose tag is not one (e.g. n8n\_image\_tag = "2.27.4-mypackages" together with n8n\_task\_runner\_image\_tag = "2.27.4"); otherwise the sidecar tries to pull `n8nio/runners:2.27.4-mypackages` and every main and worker pod stays in ImagePullBackOff. Reproduced on a live cluster, where kubelet reported `docker.io/n8nio/runners:<tag>: not found`; because the release waits for readiness, the apply blocks and then fails rather than completing with broken pods, and webhook processors are unaffected since they run no runner sidecar. The tag should match the n8n version in the application image, since the runner protocol is versioned with n8n. Ignored when n8n\_task\_runners\_enabled = false. | `string` | `null` | no |

Wired to the N8N\_RUNNERS\_TASK\_REQUEST\_TIMEOUT env var on the main pod. Increase if Code nodes fail with 'task request timed out' under high concurrency (many parallel Code nodes competing for the single runner sidecar). | `number` | `300` | no |

| <a name="input_n8n_templates_enabled"></a> [n8n\_templates\_enabled](#input\_n8n\_templates\_enabled) | Enable n8n's workflow templates and template suggestions. Maps to N8N\_TEMPLATES\_ENABLED. When false, sets N8N\_TEMPLATES\_ENABLED=false on all n8n pods (main, worker, webhook processor) via config.extraEnv. Defaults to true, matching n8n's own default — note that explicitly setting true emits no env var (n8n's default already applies). Set to false to hide the templates library, e.g. when enforcing curated internal workflows. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_termination_grace_period"></a> [n8n\_termination\_grace\_period](#input\_n8n\_termination\_grace\_period) | Seconds Kubernetes waits after SIGTERM before force-killing pods.

| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_cpu_request"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_cpu\_request](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_cpu\_request) | CPU request for n8n webhook processor pods (e.g. 300m, 500m). This default is sized for typical webhook traffic, not for n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages = true: a low request against an npm-install CPU spike is what drives the CPU-based HPA into a scale-up-on-every-rollout loop. Raise to at least 800m when that toggle is on; see n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages and docs/troubleshooting.md. | `string` | `"300m"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_hpa_cpu_threshold"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_cpu\_threshold](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_cpu\_threshold) | Target average CPU utilization (%) that triggers scaling of n8n webhook pods. | `number` | `65` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_hpa_max_replicas"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_max\_replicas](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_max\_replicas) | Maximum replicas for n8n webhook processor pods. HPA will not scale above this. The default of 8 is sized to the default node group (node\_max × node\_instance\_type), alongside the main and worker ceilings. Webhook processors are the cheapest pod family to scale (no task runner sidecar, 300m by default), so this is usually the first ceiling to raise once node\_max goes up. See n8n\_main\_hpa\_max\_replicas and README.md → "Sizing autoscaling against node capacity". | `number` | `8` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_hpa_min_replicas"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_min\_replicas](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_min\_replicas) | Minimum replicas for n8n webhook processor pods. HPA will not scale below this. Also becomes the deployment's own replica count: the Helm chart renders spec.replicas unconditionally, so leaving it below the autoscaler floor would make every helm upgrade scale down and then wait for the autoscaler to climb back. Webhook processors take production webhook traffic, so a warm floor is what keeps a traffic ramp from queueing behind pod startup. | `number` | `2` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_hpa_scale_up_stabilization_window_seconds"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_scale\_up\_stabilization\_window\_seconds](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_scale\_up\_stabilization\_window\_seconds) | Seconds the webhook processor HPA looks back before scaling up, via the HPA's behavior.scaleUp.stabilizationWindowSeconds. Kubernetes' own default is 0 (scale up immediately), which this module preserves by default. A short CPU spike right after a pod boots (e.g. from N8N\_REINSTALL\_MISSING\_PACKAGES=true reinstalling community packages, see n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages) can read as sustained high utilization and trigger a scale-up that a slightly longer window would absorb. Raise this (e.g. to 300) to require CPU to stay above threshold for that long before adding pods. Must be between 0 and 3600, the range the Kubernetes API enforces. | `number` | `0` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_memory_limit"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_memory\_limit](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_memory\_limit) | Memory limit for n8n webhook processor pods (e.g. 1Gi, 2Gi). This default is too low for n8n\_reinstall\_missing\_packages = true: concurrent npm installs plus the n8n baseline can exceed it and OOMKill the pod mid-install into a reinstall/broadcast crash loop. Raise to at least 2Gi when that toggle is on; see that variable and docs/troubleshooting.md. | `string` | `"1Gi"` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_memory_request"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_memory\_request](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_memory\_request) | Memory request for n8n webhook processor pods (e.g. 512Mi, 1Gi).

| <a name="input_n8n_webhook_url"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_url](#input\_n8n\_webhook\_url) | Public HTTPS base URL used for webhook callbacks (e.g. <https://webhooks.example.com>).

KEDA targets ceil(queue\_depth / jobs\_per\_replica) replicas. | `number` | `5` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_worker_keda_max_replicas"></a> [n8n\_worker\_keda\_max\_replicas](#input\_n8n\_worker\_keda\_max\_replicas) | Maximum worker replicas KEDA may scale to. Workers compete for the same nodes as the main and webhook pods, and each carries a task runner sidecar, so this ceiling counts against the same node group budget as the two HPA maxima. See README.md → "Sizing autoscaling against node capacity". | `number` | `10` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_worker_keda_min_replicas"></a> [n8n\_worker\_keda\_min\_replicas](#input\_n8n\_worker\_keda\_min\_replicas) | Minimum worker replicas. KEDA keeps at least this many workers running even when the queue is empty. Also becomes the deployment's own replica count: the Helm chart renders spec.replicas unconditionally, so leaving it below the autoscaler floor would make every helm upgrade scale down and then wait for the autoscaler to climb back. | `number` | `1` | no |
| <a name="input_n8n_worker_memory_limit"></a> [n8n\_worker\_memory\_limit](#input\_n8n\_worker\_memory\_limit) | Memory limit for n8n worker pods (e.g. 2Gi, 4Gi) | `string` | `"2Gi"` | no |

| <a name="input_node_desired"></a> [node\_desired](#input\_node\_desired) | Initial number of worker nodes. Only applies at creation: the node group's desired\_size ignores changes afterward so the Cluster Autoscaler can own it without fighting plans/applies. | `number` | `3` | no |
| <a name="input_node_instance_type"></a> [node\_instance\_type](#input\_node\_instance\_type) | EC2 instance type for EKS worker nodes. t3.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16GB) is the recommended minimum for multi-main — the 6 n8n pods (main × 2, worker × 2, webhook × 2) request ~3,600m CPU at minimum replicas, leaving t3.medium nodes with insufficient headroom for HPA to scale. | `string` | `"t3.xlarge"` | no |
| <a name="input_node_max"></a> [node\_max](#input\_node\_max) | Maximum number of worker nodes. This is the ceiling the Cluster Autoscaler scales to, so node\_max × node\_instance\_type is the hard cap on schedulable CPU: the autoscaler maxima (n8n\_main\_hpa\_max\_replicas, n8n\_webhook\_hpa\_max\_replicas, n8n\_worker\_keda\_max\_replicas) and the per-pod CPU requests have to fit inside it. The module warns at plan time when they do not; see README.md → "Sizing autoscaling against node capacity". | `number` | `6` | no |

| <a name="input_public_subnets"></a> [public\_subnets](#input\_public\_subnets) | IDs of public subnets (one per AZ, minimum two AZs). The ALB attaches here. | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_redis_apply_immediately"></a> [redis\_apply\_immediately](#input\_redis\_apply\_immediately) | Apply ElastiCache modifications as soon as the apply runs, rather than deferring them to the next maintenance window. Defaults to false, matching the AWS default and leaving every existing deployment's behaviour unchanged. Set true when changing redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode: AWS rejects any transit-encryption modification outright without it, with `InvalidParameterValue: Transit encryption modification should be called with applied immediately option.`, so the migration cannot proceed while this is false. Turning it on makes other modifications immediate too, which for a replication group can mean a node reboot outside the window you picked, so prefer scoping it to the applies that need it rather than leaving it on. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_high_availability_enabled"></a> [redis\_high\_availability\_enabled](#input\_redis\_high\_availability\_enabled) | When true, provision Redis as a two-node aws\_elasticache\_replication\_group (one primary, one replica) with automatic\_failover\_enabled and multi\_az\_enabled, instead of the default single-node aws\_elasticache\_cluster. Redis backs the Bull queue that distributes executions across workers and the multi-main leader election, so the default single node is a single point of failure: a node or AZ event stalls both until ElastiCache replaces it. Both nodes use redis\_node\_type, so the Redis cost roughly doubles. What this buys is that the QUEUE SURVIVES the node loss, not that n8n rides the failover out: measured on a live cluster, ElastiCache promotes the replica in about 20 seconds and every main, worker and webhook pod exits and restarts during that window (n8n's RedisClientService calls process.exit once Redis has been unreachable for QUEUE\_BULL\_REDIS\_TIMEOUT\_THRESHOLD; raising that threshold to 30s was tried and still fell short of this failover, though a larger reconnect budget can ride one out, and wiring that threshold up is the follow-up in PR #77). Recovery is automatic and takes well under a minute, and the queued executions are still there on the promoted node. Compare that with the single-node default, where a lost node means waiting for AWS to build a new one and the queue is gone with it. FLIPPING THIS ON A DEFAULT DEPLOYMENT REPLACES REDIS: the two topologies are different resource types, so no `moved` block can bridge them and Terraform destroys the cluster before creating the replication group. Every queued and in-flight execution in Redis at that moment is lost. A deployment that already has redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled = true is on a replication group already, so Terraform modifies that replication group in place rather than replacing it. Live testing confirmed that the provider converges this direction in stages: the first apply raises the node count through ElastiCache's IncreaseReplicaCount API and returns with automatic failover still disabled; rerun plan and apply after the group is available to enable failover. The default redis\_apply\_immediately = false schedules that second change for the maintenance window; set it to true for the second apply to activate failover immediately, then unset it. Drain first and see README → "Adding high availability to an encrypted group" for the measured sequence. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_host"></a> [redis\_host](#input\_redis\_host) | External Redis host. Required when create\_elasticache = false. Ignored otherwise. Must be reachable from the EKS node subnets on redis\_port, and must accept unauthenticated, non-TLS connections, because the module wires neither a Redis password nor TLS. For a replication group the caller manages, use its primary endpoint rather than a node address, so the name follows the primary across a failover. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_kms_encryption_enabled"></a> [redis\_kms\_encryption\_enabled](#input\_redis\_kms\_encryption\_enabled) | When true, encrypt Redis at rest with a module-created Customer Managed KMS Key (aws\_kms\_key.redis). Defaults to false, which leaves the default standalone aws\_elasticache\_cluster unencrypted at rest: Redis OSS at-rest encryption is available only on aws\_elasticache\_replication\_group. Existing replication-group paths selected by HA or TLS are encrypted with the ElastiCache-managed key because redis.tf sets at\_rest\_encryption\_enabled = true there. kms\_key\_id is also replication-group-only, so this is one of three variables (alongside redis\_high\_availability\_enabled and redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled) that independently select the replication group. Setting this true on a default deployment replaces the standalone cache with a one-node replication group and drops queued work; drain the queue and use a maintenance window. On an existing replication group, changing kms\_key\_id is also ForceNew. The CMK rotates annually and uses a 7-day deletion window (AWS minimum). Ignored when create\_elasticache = false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_node_type"></a> [redis\_node\_type](#input\_redis\_node\_type) | ElastiCache node type (cache.t3.medium ~$25/month). Sizes the single node when redis\_high\_availability\_enabled = false, and every node in the replication group when it is true, so the Redis line of the bill scales with the node count, not just the type. Ignored when create\_elasticache = false. | `string` | `"cache.t3.medium"` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_port"></a> [redis\_port](#input\_redis\_port) | Port of the external Redis specified by redis\_host. Ignored when create\_elasticache = true, because module-managed ElastiCache always listens on 6379. | `number` | `6379` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_snapshot_retention_limit"></a> [redis\_snapshot\_retention\_limit](#input\_redis\_snapshot\_retention\_limit) | Number of daily automatic ElastiCache snapshots to retain. 0 disables snapshots. Defaults to 1: this Redis backs n8n's BullMQ queue, not a source of truth, so a snapshot only shortens recovery of in-flight queued executions after a failure. Applies to both Redis topologies, the single-node cluster and the replication group selected by redis\_high\_availability\_enabled, redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled, or redis\_kms\_encryption\_enabled. Clears Checkov finding CKV\_AWS\_134. | `number` | `1` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_transit_encryption_enabled"></a> [redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled](#input\_redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled) | Encrypt the n8n queue backend in transit and require an AUTH token on it. Defaults to false, which is the module's deliberate network-trust posture: Redis sits in private subnets behind a security group that admits only VPC traffic, so isolation is by network boundary rather than by credentials. Set true to add TLS plus a generated AUTH token on top of that boundary, worth doing when queue payloads (workflow execution data) crossing the VPC in cleartext, or an unauthenticated Redis after a network-boundary breach, are risks you need closed. Independent of redis\_high\_availability\_enabled: this buys encryption and authentication only, and leaves the cache at one node. CHANGING THIS ON AN EXISTING DEPLOYMENT REPLACES REDIS: AWS exposes the AUTH token only on aws\_elasticache\_replication\_group, so enabling it moves a default deployment off aws\_elasticache\_cluster, which drops every job queued at that moment. Drain workers and pick a maintenance window. Enabling it on a deployment that is ALREADY on a replication group (redis\_high\_availability\_enabled = true) is supported but takes three applies, not one: AWS refuses a direct plaintext-to-encrypted transition and requires the group to pass through transit\_encryption\_mode = preferred first, and it refuses an AUTH token until the mode is required. Setting this variable on its own therefore plans clean and then fails at apply. Drive the migration with redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode and redis\_apply\_immediately instead. The full sequence was run against a live cluster with a client connection held open across every step and interrupted service at no point; see README for the three steps, their measured durations, and why the third one is not optional. Worker queue-depth autoscaling is unaffected: KEDA's Redis triggers pick up TLS and the AUTH token alongside the workers themselves. Requires create\_elasticache = true, since the module cannot put a token on a Redis it does not manage. Retrieve the generated token with `terraform output -raw redis_auth_token`. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_redis_transit_encryption_mode"></a> [redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode](#input\_redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode) | Which clients the Redis replication group accepts while transit encryption is on. "required" (the default) accepts TLS only, and is where a deployment should end up. "preferred" accepts TLS AND plaintext on the same endpoint at the same time, which is the only way AWS allows transit encryption to be turned on for a replication group that already exists: it refuses a direct disabled-to-enabled transition and demands a pass through preferred first. That makes this input the migration lever rather than a tuning knob. A caller creating Redis for the first time should leave it alone; a caller adding redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled to a deployment already running redis\_high\_availability\_enabled sets it to "preferred" for one apply and then back to "required", with redis\_apply\_immediately = true throughout. See README → "Adding TLS to an existing replication group" for the full sequence, including where the pods have to roll. Only written when redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled = true, since it describes a property of transit encryption; ignored otherwise. Sitting on "preferred" indefinitely is valid as far as AWS is concerned but leaves the endpoint accepting cleartext, so it defeats the point of enabling the feature. | `string` | `"required"` | no |
| <a name="input_route53_zone_id"></a> [route53\_zone\_id](#input\_route53\_zone\_id) | Route53 hosted zone ID for the parent of n8n\_domain (e.g. the zone for example.com if n8n\_domain = n8n.example.com). When set, the module issues a DNS-validated ACM certificate and creates the alias A-record automatically — single terraform apply, no manual DNS steps. Leave null and pass certificate\_arn instead. Set exactly one of certificate\_arn or route53\_zone\_id. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_s3_kms_encryption_enabled"></a> [s3\_kms\_encryption\_enabled](#input\_s3\_kms\_encryption\_enabled) | When true (the default), set the S3 bucket's default encryption to SSE-KMS with a module-created Customer Managed KMS Key (aws\_kms\_key.s3) and grant the n8n pod role kms:Decrypt / kms:GenerateDataKey on it. Clears Checkov finding CKV\_AWS\_145. This selects which key encrypts objects, not whether they are encrypted: S3 encrypts every object regardless, and setting this to false leaves new objects on SSE-S3 with S3-managed keys. S3 Bucket Keys are enabled alongside it so KMS is called per bucket rather than per object. The setting applies only to objects written afterwards: existing objects keep their original encryption. Do not change true to false while any retained object uses this CMK. Terraform immediately schedules the key for deletion, making those objects unreadable while the key is PendingDeletion and permanently unrecoverable after the 7-day window. See README → KMS key after terraform destroy for recovery. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| <a name="input_tags"></a> [tags](#input\_tags) | Additional AWS tags to apply to all resources this module creates. Merged on top of the built-in ManagedBy/Project tags. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| <a name="input_vpc_cidr_block"></a> [vpc\_cidr\_block](#input\_vpc\_cidr\_block) | CIDR block of the VPC — used by the RDS and Redis security groups to allow intra-VPC traffic. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_vpc_id"></a> [vpc\_id](#input\_vpc\_id) | ID of the VPC n8n will deploy into. Must contain both public and private subnets with the EKS/ALB subnet tags applied. | `string` | n/a | yes |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <a name="output_alb_hostname"></a> [alb\_hostname](#output\_alb\_hostname) | ALB hostname of the module-managed Ingress. When route53\_zone\_id is set, the module already creates the alias record, so this output is informational. When certificate\_arn is used, create a CNAME: your domain → this value. Null when create\_ingress = false, since the caller then owns the load balancers. |
| <a name="output_aws_region"></a> [aws\_region](#output\_aws\_region) | AWS region |
| <a name="output_certificate_arn"></a> [certificate\_arn](#output\_certificate\_arn) | ARN of the ACM certificate n8n is served with. When route53\_zone\_id is set this is the module-issued certificate, already validated, covering n8n\_domain plus every entry in n8n\_additional\_domains. When certificate\_arn is supplied instead, it is echoed back unchanged. A caller owning its own Ingress resources (create\_ingress = false) attaches this to their alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn annotation, which lets the module issue and validate a multi-name certificate on their behalf rather than the caller hand-rolling one. Sourced from aws\_acm\_certificate\_validation, so consuming it orders the caller's resources after validation completes. |
| <a name="output_cluster_certificate_authority_data"></a> [cluster\_certificate\_authority\_data](#output\_cluster\_certificate\_authority\_data) | Base64-encoded EKS cluster CA certificate — pass to kubernetes/helm providers as cluster\_ca\_certificate (after base64decode). |
| <a name="output_cluster_endpoint"></a> [cluster\_endpoint](#output\_cluster\_endpoint) | EKS cluster API endpoint — pass to the kubernetes/helm providers as host. |
| <a name="output_cluster_name"></a> [cluster\_name](#output\_cluster\_name) | EKS cluster name |
| <a name="output_db_password"></a> [db\_password](#output\_db\_password) | Database password — module-managed when create\_database = true, or the value of var.db\_password when using an external database. Retrieve with: terraform output -raw db\_password |
| <a name="output_kubectl_config_command"></a> [kubectl\_config\_command](#output\_kubectl\_config\_command) | Command to configure kubectl for this cluster |
| <a name="output_n8n_encryption_key"></a> [n8n\_encryption\_key](#output\_n8n\_encryption\_key) | n8n encryption key — back this up in a password manager. Losing it makes all stored credentials unreadable. |
| <a name="output_n8n_service_name"></a> [n8n\_service\_name](#output\_n8n\_service\_name) | Name of the Kubernetes Service fronting the n8n main pods (the editor UI and REST API), on port 5678. Point a bring-your-own Ingress at this when create\_ingress = false. |
| <a name="output_n8n_service_port"></a> [n8n\_service\_port](#output\_n8n\_service\_port) | Port both n8n Services listen on. Use with n8n\_service\_name / n8n\_webhook\_service\_name when building your own Ingress. |
| <a name="output_n8n_url"></a> [n8n\_url](#output\_n8n\_url) | URL to access n8n once DNS propagates |
| <a name="output_n8n_webhook_path_prefixes"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_path\_prefixes](#output\_n8n\_webhook\_path\_prefixes) | Path prefixes that must be routed to n8n\_webhook\_service\_name rather than n8n\_service\_name. The main pods run with production webhooks disabled, so every one of these returns 404 if it reaches them: /webhook, /webhook-waiting (also carries the Slack and Telegram human-in-the-loop callbacks), /form, /form-waiting, and /mcp. Route all of them when building your own Ingress with create\_ingress = false. |
| <a name="output_n8n_webhook_service_name"></a> [n8n\_webhook\_service\_name](#output\_n8n\_webhook\_service\_name) | Name of the Kubernetes Service fronting the n8n webhook processors, on port 5678. Production webhooks are disabled on the main pods, so a bring-your-own Ingress must route /webhook here. |
| <a name="output_namespace"></a> [namespace](#output\_namespace) | Kubernetes namespace n8n is deployed into. |
| <a name="output_node_group_role_arn"></a> [node\_group\_role\_arn](#output\_node\_group\_role\_arn) | IAM role ARN the EKS node group runs under, and therefore the principal the kubelet pulls container images as. Name it in a cross-account ECR repository policy to let this cluster pull a custom n8n image from a registry in another account, which is the mechanism to reach for there: an ECR authorization token lasts 12 hours, so an imagePullSecrets holding one goes stale long before the next apply. For registries that issue static credentials, use n8n\_image\_pull\_secrets instead. |
| <a name="output_rds_endpoint"></a> [rds\_endpoint](#output\_rds\_endpoint) | Database endpoint — module-managed RDS when create\_database = true, or the value of var.db\_host when using an external database (e.g. Aurora). |
| <a name="output_redis_auth_token"></a> [redis\_auth\_token](#output\_redis\_auth\_token) | ElastiCache AUTH token when redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled = true and redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode = "required" (the default); null otherwise, since the default posture has no credential and the transitional redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode = "preferred" state does not carry a token either. Retrieve with: terraform output -raw redis\_auth\_token |
| <a name="output_redis_endpoint"></a> [redis\_endpoint](#output\_redis\_endpoint) | Redis host n8n and KEDA connect to. The single cache node's address by default; the replication group's primary endpoint when redis\_high\_availability\_enabled or redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled is true, which is the name AWS repoints at the surviving node on failover; or the value of var.redis\_host when create\_elasticache = false. Reached over TLS and requiring redis\_auth\_token when redis\_transit\_encryption\_enabled = true and redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode = "required" (the default); with redis\_transit\_encryption\_mode = "preferred", the transitional state used while migrating an existing replication group, the endpoint still accepts plaintext and there is no token. |
| <a name="output_redis_port"></a> [redis\_port](#output\_redis\_port) | Port n8n and KEDA connect to Redis on. Always 6379 for module-managed ElastiCache; the value of var.redis\_port when create\_elasticache = false. Paired with redis\_endpoint so a caller wiring its own queue-depth scaler or a debug pod does not have to assume the port. |
| <a name="output_s3_bucket_name"></a> [s3\_bucket\_name](#output\_s3\_bucket\_name) | S3 bucket used for n8n binary storage, and for execution data when n8n\_execution\_data\_storage\_mode = "s3". The module attaches no lifecycle configuration: binary data is pruned only by S3 while execution data is pruned by n8n itself, and the two cannot be separated by a prefix filter. Read the S3 lifecycle section of the README before attaching one. |
