# A single CMK encrypts the RDS instance storage (CKV_AWS_16), Performance
# Insights data (CKV_AWS_354), and the postgresql CloudWatch log group
# (CKV_AWS_158) — replacing the AWS-managed `aws/rds` default. Mirrors the
# Aurora CMK pattern established for examples/large/ (PR #13).
#
# Gated on var.db_storage_encrypted so callers with existing unencrypted RDS
# deployments can opt out and avoid the RDS replacement that enabling storage
# encryption triggers (AWS does not support flipping storage_encrypted in
# place — see README.md → "Upgrading from a pre-CMK apply").
#
# enable_key_rotation     = true → annual rotation, no operator action.
# deletion_window_in_days = 7    → AWS minimum so `terraform destroy` recycles
#                                  the key as fast as AWS permits.
#
# The key policy grants the regional CloudWatch Logs service principal the
# Encrypt/Decrypt actions needed for the log group, scoped via
# kms:EncryptionContext:aws:logs:arn to this instance's postgresql log group
# only — the key cannot be used to read any other log group's data. RDS uses
# the key via IAM-mediated access, covered by the EnableRootAccess statement
# plus the caller's IAM permissions.

# collide on the alias name during the 7-day key deletion window. The

# ── Parameter group (query logging + enforced TLS) ────────────────────────────

# slow or stuck n8n instance (CKV2_AWS_30) and requires TLS on every connection
# (CKV2_AWS_69).
#
# Deliberately not log_statement = "all". n8n's queries carry workflow and
# execution payloads, so logging every statement would copy customer data into
# CloudWatch Logs and scale ingestion cost with execution volume. "ddl" logs
# schema changes only (n8n runs migrations on startup, which is exactly what
# you want in the log after an upgrade), and the 1000 ms threshold catches slow
# queries without touching normal traffic.
#
# rds.force_ssl = 1 is already the RDS default for PostgreSQL 15 and later (it
# is 0 on 14 and older), so at this module's default db_engine_version it
# changes nothing and only closes the gap for callers who pin an older major.
# It is safe against the module's own topology either way: n8n connects over
# TLS by default (db_postgresdb_ssl_enabled), and the documented reason to set
# that to false is an in-cluster pooler that terminates TLS on its own upstream
# leg to the database.
#
# Opt-in because engine_version is intentionally ignored on the instance. An
# existing database can therefore still run PostgreSQL 16 while
# var.db_engine_version is 18.4; attaching a postgres18 group to it fails at the
# RDS API. Callers enable this only when the live major matches the configured
# major. Switching from the default group takes effect after a reboot.
