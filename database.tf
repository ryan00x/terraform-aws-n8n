# ── Customer Managed KMS key (optional) ───────────────────────────────────────
# A single CMK encrypts the RDS instance storage (CKV_AWS_16), Performance
# Insights data (CKV_AWS_354), and the postgresql CloudWatch log group
# (CKV_AWS_158) — replacing the AWS-managed `aws/rds` default. Mirrors the
# Aurora CMK pattern established for examples/large/ (PR #13).
#
# Gated on var.db_storage_encrypted so callers with existing unencrypted RDS
# deployments can opt out and avoid the RDS replacement that enabling storage
# encryption triggers (AWS does not support flipping storage_encrypted in
# place — see README.md → "Upgrading from a pre-CMK apply").
#
# Also gated on var.create_db_kms_key: when a caller supplies their own KMS key
# (e.g. a centrally-managed CMK a security team already owns), the module must
# not mint a second one.
#
# The toggle is a boolean rather than `var.db_kms_key_arn == null`, even though
# the ARN's nullness looks like it carries the same information. It does not,
# for count purposes. An input is only plan-time-known if the *caller's*
# expression for it is, and `db_kms_key_arn = aws_kms_key.mine.arn` is a
# perfectly reasonable thing to write and completely unknown until apply.
# Comparing that to null yields an unknown, and an unknown count fails the plan
# outright with "The count value depends on resource attributes that cannot be
# determined until apply". A boolean the caller writes as a literal sidesteps
# it, and lets the ARN beside it be computed. Same reasoning as
# create_database / create_elasticache elsewhere in this module; see
# docs/customer-managed-infrastructure.md → "Why a static boolean, not
# `x == null` inference".
#
# enable_key_rotation     = true → annual rotation, no operator action.
# deletion_window_in_days = 7    → AWS minimum so `terraform destroy` recycles
#                                  the key as fast as AWS permits.
#
# The key policy grants the regional CloudWatch Logs service principal the
# Encrypt/Decrypt actions needed for the log group, scoped via
# kms:EncryptionContext:aws:logs:arn to this instance's postgresql log group
# only — the key cannot be used to read any other log group's data. RDS uses
# the key via IAM-mediated access, covered by the EnableRootAccess statement
# plus the caller's IAM permissions.
#
# aws_kms_alias.db uses name_prefix so apply→destroy→apply cycles do not
# collide on the alias name during the 7-day key deletion window. The
# auto-generated AWS suffix makes the alias unique per apply.

# unencrypted deployments see no plan change on this resource either.
#
# This is the one consumer of the key that AWS refuses outright rather than
# degrades. RDS reaches the key through a grant, so storage and Performance
# Insights work with nothing more than the default root statement in the key
# policy. CloudWatch Logs does not: creating a log group against a key whose
# policy has no logs.<region>.amazonaws.com statement fails with
# InvalidParameterException, and it fails here, before the instance is created,
# leaving a half-built stack. No AWS provider data source returns a key policy,
# so the module cannot check for that statement at plan time.
#
# Hence local.db_logs_kms_key_arn rather than local.db_kms_key_arn: the module
# only puts a key on this log group when it knows the key can be used.

#     Insights, the data that actually matters. A check block says out loud
#     that this happened, so it is disclosed rather than silent.

# group turns on the two settings that make that export useful for diagnosing a
# slow or stuck n8n instance (CKV2_AWS_30) and requires TLS on every connection
# (CKV2_AWS_69).
#
# Deliberately not log_statement = "all". n8n's queries carry workflow and
# execution payloads, so logging every statement would copy customer data into
# CloudWatch Logs and scale ingestion cost with execution volume. "ddl" logs
# schema changes only (n8n runs migrations on startup, which is exactly what
# you want in the log after an upgrade), and the 1000 ms threshold catches slow
# queries without touching normal traffic.
#
# rds.force_ssl = 1 is already the RDS default for PostgreSQL 15 and later (it
# is 0 on 14 and older), so at this module's default db_engine_version it
# changes nothing and only closes the gap for callers who pin an older major.
# It is safe against the module's own topology either way: n8n connects over
# TLS by default (db_postgresdb_ssl_enabled), and the documented reason to set
# that to false is an in-cluster pooler that terminates TLS on its own upstream
# leg to the database.
#
# Opt-in because engine_version is intentionally ignored on the instance. An
# existing database can therefore still run PostgreSQL 16 while
