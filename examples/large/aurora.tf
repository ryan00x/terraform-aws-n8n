# ── Aurora PostgreSQL (I/O-Optimized) ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Aurora I/O-Optimized removes the IOPS ceiling that limits RDS gp3 at high
# write throughput. Benchmarked at 14,000–15,000 TPS sustained without
# degradation at 960+ req/s — RDS gp3 saturated at ~600 req/s under the same
# load.
#
# Two instances (writer + reader) provide:
#   - Automatic failover to the reader if the writer becomes unavailable.
#   - Read replica offloads reporting / analytics queries from the writer.
#
# The module-managed RDS instance is skipped (db_host is set in main.tf).
#
# n8n does not officially support Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL or other
# Postgres-compatible derivatives (AlloyDB, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, etc.).
# This example may work, but it is not tested or certified against Aurora
# specifically; issues that reproduce only on Aurora are outside official
# support scope. It stays in this repo for the I/O-Optimized throughput
# numbers above, which are specific to Aurora's storage engine.

  # data flow:
  #
  #   random_password.aurora.result

  #
  # If a future maintainer plumbs this password into a `postgres://` connection

# Verified against the RDS API rather than assumed, because the error only
# surfaces at apply time (`terraform test` runs against a mocked provider that
# does not validate parameter names). Of the 142 parameters in the
# aurora-postgresql18 DB CLUSTER parameter family, `rds.force_ssl` is present
# and `log_statement` / `log_min_duration_statement` are not; both of the latter
# are in the DB (instance) parameter family instead. The same holds for
# aurora-postgresql16, so this is how Aurora PostgreSQL is shaped, not something
# the 18.4 bump introduced:
#
#   aws rds describe-engine-default-cluster-parameters \
#     --db-parameter-group-family aurora-postgresql18 \
#     --query 'EngineDefaults.Parameters[].ParameterName' --output text
#
# Putting the two log parameters on the cluster group anyway, which is literally
# what Checkov's CKV2_AWS_27 asks for, fails the apply with "Could not find
# parameter with name: log_statement". See the checkov:skip on aws_rds_cluster
# below for why the finding is annotated rather than satisfied.
#
# rds.force_ssl = 1 matches what the only client of this cluster already does:
# PgBouncer connects upstream with SERVER_TLS_SSLMODE = require (pgbouncer.tf).
# The n8n-to-PgBouncer leg is plain TCP inside the cluster
# (db_postgresdb_ssl_enabled = false in main.tf) and is unaffected by a
# cluster-level parameter. It is also already the AWS default on this family, so
