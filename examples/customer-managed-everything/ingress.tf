# ── Customer-managed Ingress ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# create_ingress = false on module.n8n means the module creates no Ingress of
# its own. This example owns one instead, routed at the ALB the
# directly-invoked module.controllers' Load Balancer Controller provisions
# (main.tf), exactly the pattern install_lbc's own validation error message
# points at: "set create_ingress = false and point your own Ingress resources
# at an LBC you install another way."
#
# Single ALB, not the two-ALB split examples/split-ingress demonstrates: this
# example is about customer-managed backing infrastructure and controllers,
# not about Ingress topology, so it reuses the same routing shape the module's
# own create_ingress = true path renders (ingress.tf's kubernetes_ingress_v1.n8n
# in the repo root), just as a caller-owned resource instead of a module-owned
# one.
