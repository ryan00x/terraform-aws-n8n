# Plan-time tests for the customer-managed-s3 example using mocked providers.

# Exercises the VPC + stand-in bucket + module wiring without contacting AWS.

# Run: terraform test
#   (from examples/customer-managed-s3/, mocks require terraform >= 1.7,
#   and the override_resource block below needs terraform >= 1.11
#   specifically; see the comment on that block)

  # aws_s3_bucket.customer_managed.id is unknown at plan time for a
  # not-yet-created bucket, same as any computed AWS attribute under mocking,
  # and this run's own assertion compares module.n8n.s3_bucket_name against it
  # directly, which a `command = plan` run can't do with an unknown value.
  # override_during = plan is required: without it, an override_resource
  # block only applies during apply (the default), and silently has no effect
  # on a plan-only run. override_during needs Terraform >= 1.11: the
  # attribute was added by hashicorp/terraform#36227 and shipped in v1.11
  # (#36312 is only the docs update for it, and is the wrong thing to cite
  # when tracing the requirement). This example's own versions.tf declares
  # that floor, and CI's single pinned Terraform version sits above it (see
  # terraform-tests.yml). command = apply is not a substitute at
  # any Terraform version: this example still creates a real EKS cluster
  # (create_eks defaults to true here), and a full mocked apply makes every
  # computed AWS attribute in that graph, not just this one, come back as a
  # non-ARN-shaped mock string, which fails the Pod Identity association's
  # own role_arn/policy_arn validation elsewhere in the same plan. Confirmed
  # by direct experimentation, not assumed.
