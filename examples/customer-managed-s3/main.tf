# ── Customer-managed S3 bucket (stand-in) ────────────────────────────────────
# Everything in this section is playing the part of infrastructure a customer
# already has running before they ever point this module at it. It is plain
# Terraform, entirely independent of the n8n module: nothing here is created
# by, or known to, module "n8n" below except through existing_s3_bucket_name.
#
# A real customer-managed bucket exercises the same module input without any
# of this: delete this section, and set the module's existing_s3_bucket_name
# to your existing bucket's own name directly. See "Adapting to your real
# infrastructure" in this example's README.
#
# Deliberately secured with its own public-access block and SSE-S3 encryption
# configuration here, entirely independent of the module: s3.tf's design
# leaves a customer-managed bucket's security configuration to its owner, not
# to this module, so this example's stand-in configures its own rather than
# relying on the module to do it.

  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Server access logging needs a second bucket to receive the logs, which this single-bucket stand-in does not create, same reasoning as this module's own aws_s3_bucket.n8n.
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_144:Cross-region replication needs a destination bucket in a second region, which this single-region example does not create.
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_145:Deliberately SSE-S3 (see the encryption configuration below), not SSE-KMS: this stand-in models a plausible minimum-viable customer bucket, not this module's own KMS-by-default posture (s3_kms_encryption_enabled). A real customer-managed bucket's actual encryption is the caller's decision, wired through s3_kms_key_arn if it is SSE-KMS.
  # checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_61:No lifecycle configuration, by design, same reasoning as this module's own aws_s3_bucket.n8n: leaving object expiry to the caller is the only option that cannot silently delete data n8n still references.
