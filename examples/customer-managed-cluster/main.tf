# ── Customer-managed EKS cluster (stand-in) ──────────────────────────────────
# Everything in this section is playing the part of a platform team's already
# existing EKS cluster, provisioned before anyone ever pointed this module at
# it. It is plain Terraform, entirely independent of the n8n module: nothing
# here is created by, or known to, module "n8n" below except through the
# reference variable it's wired to (existing_eks_cluster_name).
#
# A real customer-managed cluster exercises the same module inputs without
# any of this: delete this whole section, and set the module's
# existing_eks_cluster_name to your existing cluster's own name. See
# "Adapting to your real infrastructure" in this example's README.
#
# Sized the same as examples/small's module-created cluster (t3.xlarge nodes,
# desired/min 3, max 6), not a cheaper demo tier: the module's own
# node_instance_type description warns that anything smaller leaves
# insufficient headroom for HPA to scale the full multi-main n8n workload
# (main x2, worker x2, webhook x2 at minimum replicas). A stand-in this
# example expects someone to actually apply should not silently under-provision
# the cluster it is standing in for.

# IAM role, node IAM role, or Pod Identity Agent addon of its own, and instead
# reads the stand-in cluster above by name. Everything else (RDS, Redis, S3,
# the cluster controllers, n8n itself) is still created and wired exactly as
# it would be at examples/small.
#
# existing_eks_cluster_prerequisites_confirmed = true is an attestation the
# caller makes, not something Terraform can verify; here is why each of the
# four items its description enumerates actually holds for this stand-in
# cluster specifically, not just asserted:
#
#   (1) Node capacity: sized identically to examples/small's module-created
#       cluster (t3.xlarge, desired/min 3, max 6), so the same HPA/KEDA maxima
#       this module computes fit the same way they do there.
#   (2) Cluster Autoscaler auto-discovery tags: set explicitly on
#       aws_eks_node_group.customer_managed above.
#   (3) API server reachability: the stand-in cluster's endpoint is public
#       (access_config above sets no private-only restriction), and this
#       example applies from wherever terraform apply runs, same as
#       examples/small.
#   (4) Naming and identity collisions: this is a fresh, single-purpose
#       cluster created for this example alone, so there is nothing else on
#       it for the module's IAM role names, ServiceAccount names, or Pod
#       Identity associations to collide with.
