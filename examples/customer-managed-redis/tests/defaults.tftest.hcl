# Plan-time tests for the customer-managed-redis example using mocked
# providers.
#
# Exercises the VPC + stand-in Redis + module wiring without contacting AWS.
#
# Run: terraform test
#   (from examples/customer-managed-redis/, mocks require terraform >= 1.7,
#   and the override_resource block below needs terraform >= 1.11
#   specifically; see the comment on that block)

  # The stand-in replication group's primary_endpoint_address is unknown at
  # plan time, same as every other computed AWS attribute under mocking, and
  # this run's own assertion compares module.n8n.redis_endpoint against it
  # directly, which a `command = plan` run can't do with an unknown value
  # ("Unknown condition value"). override_resource fixes this, but only with
  # override_during = plan set explicitly: without it, an override_resource
  # block applies during apply only (the default), and silently has no effect
  # on a plan-only run, which is why this was unknown the first time this test
  # was written despite the override being present. override_during needs
  # Terraform >= 1.11: the attribute was added by hashicorp/terraform#36227
  # and shipped in v1.11 (#36312 is only the docs update for it, and is the
  # wrong thing to cite when tracing the requirement). This example's own
  # versions.tf declares that floor, and CI's single pinned Terraform version
  # sits above it (see terraform-tests.yml).
  # command = apply is not a substitute at any Terraform version: this
  # example still creates a real EKS cluster (create_eks defaults to true
  # here), and a full mocked apply makes every computed AWS attribute in
  # that graph, not just this one, come back as a non-ARN-shaped mock
  # string, which fails the Pod Identity association's own
  # role_arn/policy_arn validation elsewhere in the same plan. Confirmed by
  # direct experimentation, not assumed.
