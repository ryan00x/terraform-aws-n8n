# module (create_eks = true) or supplied via existing_eks_cluster_name.
#
# Every input below that has a non-null default is also `nullable = false`.
# This submodule is documented as directly invocable (see
# examples/customer-managed-everything), which makes its variable block a
# public contract rather than an internal detail: without that, a caller
# wiring an optional value through with `foo = var.maybe_null` gets a null
# where the default is documented, and a null reaches a `count` expression or
# a Helm value instead of the documented default. The intentionally-optional
# inputs (iam_permissions_boundary_arn) keep their null default and stay
# nullable, because null is a meaningful value there.
#
# The validations mirror the root module's own for the same domains. A direct
# caller gets the same plan-time rejection of a malformed region, VPC ID,
# boundary ARN, chart repository or chart version that a caller going through
# the root module already gets, rather than an opaque AWS or Helm failure
# partway through apply.
