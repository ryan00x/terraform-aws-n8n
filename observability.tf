# ── Redis exporter (opt-in) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Bull queue depth is the signal KEDA scales workers on, and it is the first
# thing anyone asks for during an incident. n8n's own /metrics does expose a
# queue gauge, but it does not work in multi-main topologies, which is every
# tier example this module ships: only the leader main reports, so the figure
# is wrong rather than missing, which is worse. Redis itself is the source of
# truth, and this exporter is the supported way to read it from inside the
# cluster (queue depth, eviction counts, engine load, connected clients).
#
# Off by default. redis_exporter_enabled = false creates none of it, which is
# also why this is a plain Deployment rather than anything the n8n chart
# renders: the chart has no exporter of its own to enable.
#
# The exporter reads the same endpoint and the same AUTH token n8n itself
# uses, so it cannot drift from the queue n8n is actually running on. It does
# not scrape anything; a Prometheus that already discovers pods by annotation
# picks it up from the pod annotations below, and a Prometheus Operator setup
# points a ServiceMonitor at the Service.
#
# NOTE ON THE CHECKOV GATE: checkov registers its CKV_K8S_* Terraform checks
# against the UNSUFFIXED resource names (kubernetes_deployment,
# kubernetes_service) and has none for the _v1 variants used here, so a clean
# checkov run says nothing at all about this file: measured on the pinned
# 3.3.9, examples/large/pgbouncer.tf's kubernetes_deployment draws 27 checks
# while this Deployment draws zero. The _v1 names are kept anyway, because the
# module root uses versioned names throughout (kubernetes_ingress_v1,
# kubernetes_service_account_v1, kubernetes_horizontal_pod_autoscaler_v2), and
# picking an older name to be seen by a scanner is the wrong trade. The pod
# hardening below is therefore written to satisfy those checks by hand rather
# than because the gate demanded it: dropped capabilities, no privilege
# escalation, a read-only root filesystem, an explicit non-root UID, a memory
# limit, and both probes. Keep it that way when editing this file, since
# nothing in CI will tell you if it regresses.

          # certificates is present (a scratch image without it would fail
          # every TLS connection, which is the usual cause of this class of
          # bug). And REDIS_EXPORTER_TLS_SERVER_NAME is only needed when the
