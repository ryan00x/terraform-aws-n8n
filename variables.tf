(2) Cluster Autoscaler auto-discovery tags: aws_eks_node_group.n8n normally carries k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/<cluster>=owned and k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled=true; an existing node group has no guarantee of carrying them, and this module cannot tag infrastructure it does not own.

Setting this variable to a NEW value against a database that already holds credentials encrypted under a DIFFERENT key does not migrate or re-encrypt anything: n8n reads the new key, the stored credentials were written under the old one, and every one of them becomes permanently unreadable with no n8n-side recovery path. The only supported uses of a non-null value are (1) the first deployment against a brand-new, empty database, where there is nothing yet encrypted to mismatch, and (2) restoring the EXACT ORIGINAL key into a rebuilt stack pointed at a database that already holds credentials encrypted under that same original key: a rebuilt cluster, a cross-region standby, or any fresh terraform apply reattaching to an existing RDS instance or snapshot.

IMPORTANT: the module-managed ALB serves the webhook path prefixes as well as the editor UI, and this restriction applies to the whole load balancer rather than per path, so it blocks inbound production webhooks from third-party senders (Slack, Stripe, GitHub, Telegram) as surely as it blocks a browser. Use it when nothing external needs to call in, or when every sender is on a known range. To lock down the editor while keeping webhooks public, run two load balancers instead: see examples/split-ingress.

See docs/troubleshooting.md, which has the kubectl commands and covers the caller-owned Ingresses that are exposed.

Combines with alb_inbound_cidrs, which is a union rather than an intersection. Mind the security group quota: a rule referencing a prefix list counts against the rules-per-security-group quota (default 60, quota code L-0EA8095F) by the list's max-entries weight rather than as one rule, once per listen port, and this ALB listens on 80 and 443, so everything counts twice.

    group set no disk_size at all and the module exposed no input, so every
    deployment silently took the 20 GiB default regardless of pod density.

    20 GiB is not much once the node's own baseline is accounted for. Measured on
    a 42-node m7i.4xlarge cluster running n8n at load, about 7.7 GiB per node is
    consumed before any workload growth, of which roughly 2.3 GiB is OS files
    under /usr and 3.5 to 3.8 GiB is container images and layers under
    /var/lib/containerd. The kubelet begins evicting pods at around 2.1 GiB
    available. That leaves roughly 11 GiB of usable headroom on a 20 GiB volume,
    which is a good deal less than the volume size suggests.

    Size it for TRANSIENT SPIKES, not for steady-state growth. The same cluster
    was observed sitting flat for an hour and then consuming 13 to 14 GiB per node
    within about four minutes, across 40 of 42 nodes simultaneously, before
    releasing it again just as quickly. A volume sized to the steady state has no
    margin for that and the kubelet evicts, which on this workload took out 279
    pods in one episode.

# default reproduces the module's own hardcoded value exactly, so leaving all
# five unset is a no-op for every existing deployment. This is the other half
# of air-gapped support: n8n_image_repository already lets the n8n container
# image itself be mirrored, but until these existed the five charts had no
# such input, so a cluster with no egress to their public repositories could
# not come up regardless of what the image pointed at.
#
# A mirror must carry the exact version each chart is pinned to in "Chart
# versions" below, since all five versions are now explicit. Mirroring a
# subset of upstream's versions is the common case, so expect to set the
# matching *_chart_version alongside the repository rather than only the

# ── Chart versions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The four controller charts alongside n8n's own. n8n_chart_version has always
# been pinned; these four were not passed a `version` at all, which meant the
# installed version was whatever each repository's index happened to serve at
# the moment of the first apply. Two deployments of the same module commit
# could therefore be running different controller versions, and neither the
# plan nor the state made that visible until something broke.
#
# Every default is the version the public repository serves as latest as of
# 2026-08-05, so a fresh apply installs exactly what it would have installed
# unpinned. A deployment that first applied earlier and is still on an older
# chart plans an in-place Helm upgrade to the pinned version on its next apply.
# That is the intended cost: a deliberate, reviewable upgrade in a plan beats a
# version nobody chose. Override any of these to stay where you are.
#
# Bumping a default here is a module change worth its own CHANGELOG entry,
# because it upgrades a cluster-scoped controller for every consumer who has
# not pinned. See AGENTS.md → "When adding a new input".

    Defaults to null: no NODE_OPTIONS is set and V8 sizes the heap itself,
    at roughly half the container memory limit up to a fixed cap of about
    2 GiB. Measured on the pinned image (Node 26): a 1Gi limit gives a
    ~536 MiB heap, 2Gi gives ~1072 MiB, 4Gi gives ~2144 MiB, and the cap
    holds from there. So container memory above about 4Gi buys memory the
    Node process can never allocate: measured during load validation,
    webhook pods died at the ~2,033 MB old-space ceiling with half of their
    4 GiB container limit unused.

    Size it against the SMALLEST of n8n_main_memory_limit,

    Milliseconds between Bull's checks for stalled jobs. Maps to the chart's

    reason as the two lock variables. Leave null for n8n's own default (30000ms).

    n8n itself documents 0 as "disable stall checking", but THAT IS NOT REACHABLE
    THROUGH THIS CHART and this variable cannot offer it. The chart's
    values.schema.json declares redis.worker.stalledInterval as
    `{"type": "integer", "minimum": 1000}`, so 0 is rejected during schema
    validation ("minimum: got 0, want 1,000") and a quoted "0" is rejected as the
    wrong type ("got string, want integer"). The minimum of 1000 is enforced by
    the validation below so the failure lands at plan time with this
    explanation, rather than as a Helm schema error at apply time that names a
    values path and not a reason.

    Disabling stall checking on this chart therefore requires a chart change, and
    it is worth raising upstream, because of what stall detection actually does in
    n8n v2, which is less than the name suggests. n8n hardcodes Bull's
    `maxStalledCount` to 0 (packages/cli/src/scaling/scaling.service.ts), so a job
    detected as stalled is failed PERMANENTLY rather than retried, and n8n's own
    queue recovery only marks such executions `crashed` without re-running them.
    Stall detection therefore never recovers work: it converts a stalled job into
    a failure sooner. Disabling it means a slow-but-alive worker finishes its job
    instead of having it killed, at the cost of a genuinely dead worker's job
    sitting in the active list until queue recovery notices.

    Note the related QUEUE_WORKER_MAX_STALLED_COUNT is deliberately NOT exposed
    here. The chart still sets it (redis.worker.maxStalledCount, default 1) but
    n8n v2 removed the environment variable and ships a breaking-change rule
    stating it is ignored, so exposing it would offer control that does not exist.

    `saveDataOnSuccess: 'all' | 'none' = 'all'`): there is no "first" on 2.35.7, and
    the n8n default when the variable is unset is "all".

    THE REASON THIS EXISTS AS A VARIABLE. The chart renders
    `EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS` from this values path unconditionally. If a
    caller ALSO sets the same key through `n8n_extra_env`, the main and worker
    Deployments end up with the key listed twice in one container's env list.
    That is not merely untidy, it silently breaks updates: the merge key for a
    container `env` list is `name`, so a duplicated name makes Kubernetes'
    strategic-merge-patch ambiguous, and a later change can land on one
    occurrence while leaving the other stale. Kubernetes then honours the LAST
    entry at container start, so the stale value wins and the pod runs a
    configuration nobody selected.

    Observed on a live cluster 2026-08-24: after flipping the value to "all", the
    webhook-processor (which rendered the key once) correctly reported "all",
    while main and worker (which rendered it twice) both still reported "none"
    five minutes and three rollout checks later. The Helm release's own manifest
    said "all" in both positions; only the live Deployment objects disagreed.

    Set the value HERE. `n8n_extra_env` now rejects every EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_*
    key the chart renders from config.data outright at plan time (see
    local.n8n_managed_env_names), so the failure mode above can no longer be

Execution-data writes are usually the dominant write load on the n8n database at volume, so s3 is the main lever for relieving RDS pressure. Requires n8n >= 2.27 (pin n8n_image_tag accordingly) and an Enterprise license carrying the feat:executionDataS3 entitlement, which is a different entitlement from the feat:binaryDataS3 one the always-on binary data offload uses: n8n refuses to start in s3 mode without it. There is no backfill: existing executions stay readable where they were written, and only new executions go to S3, under workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/execution_data/bundle.json. n8n prunes those objects itself as part of the executions hard-delete path (see n8n_pruning_max_age / n8n_pruning_max_count), so do NOT add an S3 lifecycle rule that can reach execution_data/ objects (see the S3 lifecycle section in the README).

    Mount a custom task-runner launcher config (`n8n-task-runners.json`) over the
    one baked into the runner image, from a ConfigMap you create separately. Wires
    the chart's `taskRunners.customConfig`; leave null to use the image default.

    The launcher config is the ONLY way to set the runner allow-lists, most
    notably `N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW` for the native Python runner. The runner
    image ships that as an empty string, which refuses every stdlib import
    including `time` and `math`, so Python Code nodes that import anything fail
    with "Import of standard library module 'x' is disallowed".

    There is no env-var route to the same result, for two independent reasons:
    the allow-list names are absent from each runner's `allowed-env` list, so the
    launcher never forwards a pod-level env var to the runner process, and the
    file's own `env-overrides` block is applied regardless and would win anyway.

    The ConfigMap replaces the whole file, not one key, so derive it from the
    running image rather than writing it from scratch, and re-derive it when the
    runner image changes:

      kubectl exec deploy/n8n-worker -c task-runner -n <namespace> -- \
        cat /etc/n8n-task-runners.json > n8n-task-runners.json
      # edit the python runner's env-overrides, then:
      kubectl create configmap n8n-task-runners-custom -n <namespace> \
        --from-file=n8n-task-runners.json

    `config_map_key` defaults to the chart's own default, `n8n-task-runners.json`.

    Editing the ConfigMap afterwards does not restart anything, and the running
    pods keep the old file until you roll them yourself. The chart mounts this
    key with `subPath`, and a subPath mount never receives later updates to its
    ConfigMap, so the file on disk does not change even after kubelet's usual
    refresh. The module cannot roll the pods for you here: it is given the
    ConfigMap's name, never its contents, so it has nothing to hash into a pod
    annotation, exactly as with `redis_auth_token_secret_ref`. Restart the
    deployments after every launcher-config change:

      kubectl rollout restart deploy/n8n-main deploy/n8n-worker -n <namespace>

    The names are literal: the module pins the Helm release name to "n8n", and
    the chart's only Deployments mounting this config are <fullname>-main and
    <fullname>-worker (the webhook processor runs no task runners).

Restore and encryption key go together: restoring a database without also supplying the original n8n_encryption_key leaves every stored credential in it permanently unreadable. Four things behave differently on this path, all verified against the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot API and the AWS provider rather than assumed. (1) This forces a replacement. snapshot_identifier is ForceNew, so setting it on a deployment that already has a database destroys that database and restores this snapshot in its place; it is meant for a fresh stack, not as a way to reload an existing one. (2) The master password still applies: RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot takes no password parameter, but the provider issues a ModifyDBInstance immediately after the restore, so the module's generated password becomes the restored instance's master password. (3) Encryption comes from the snapshot and cannot be changed while restoring. Both db_storage_encrypted and the KMS key must therefore describe what the snapshot already is: an encrypted snapshot needs db_storage_encrypted = true and db_kms_key_arn set to that snapshot's own key, and an unencrypted one needs db_storage_encrypted = false. Get it wrong and Terraform wants to replace the instance on every apply, because both arguments are ForceNew and neither can be satisfied in place; re-encrypt by copying the snapshot to a new key first. Plan-time checks catch all three of those combinations. (4) RDS ignores the database name when restoring a PostgreSQL snapshot, so the restored instance keeps its own, while this module hardcodes n8n_enterprise and db_name is ForceNew too. A snapshot whose database is named anything else therefore produces a permanent replacement diff, and nothing can check it: no data source exposes a snapshot's database name.

    values path for it and `DB_` is a module-managed prefix, so this variable is
    the only way to reach it.

    Raise this when pods return 503s under load while the database itself is idle.
    n8n's ping acquires a connection from the SAME pool that serves request
    traffic (`pool.connect()` in `db-connection-monitor.ts`, raced against this
    timeout), so a pool saturated by ordinary load makes the ping time out even
    though the database is perfectly healthy. One timed-out ping sets
    `connectionState.connected = false`, and a global middleware in
    `abstract-server.ts` then answers every request to that pod with a 503,
    creating no execution row and writing no log line at the failure site.

    Measured on a production deployment with a pool size of 5: 16 to 54 connection
    requests pending per pod, acquire times of 2 to 14 seconds, 91 of 160
    webhook-processor pods affected, roughly two thirds of all requests failing,
    with Aurora and PgBouncer both idle throughout and `cl_waiting` at zero.

    This ping calls `pool.connect()`, so it is also subject to
    db_postgresdb_connection_timeout_ms when that timeout fires first. Raising
    only this value above the connection timeout does not extend the health
    check's acquisition deadline.

    Size the pool from measured concurrent database operations and pool-wait
    time, while keeping aggregate capacity across all replicas within PgBouncer
    and database limits. Raise this timeout when the queue cannot be removed, or
    as defence in depth: it costs a slower reaction to a genuinely dead database,
    which is a far cheaper failure than silently returning 503 for live traffic.

    Each ping consumes a connection from the same pool that serves request

    db_ping_timeout_ms.

    n8n waits for the interval before each attempt and schedules the next attempt
    only after the previous one finishes. At the defaults, three failures therefore
    trigger recovery after roughly 6 seconds when each ping fails immediately, but
    after roughly 21 seconds when each ping consumes the full 5-second timeout, as
    happens when pool saturation leaves `pool.connect()` queued. The response is
    destructive: n8n tears down the pool, recreates it, and suspends connection
    acquisition while it does, so every in-flight query on that pod waits. When the
    pings are failing because the pool is saturated rather than because the database
    is unreachable, that is a feedback loop: saturation causes ping failure causes
    teardown causes every query stalling causes more saturation.

    n8n's own source acknowledges this shape. The class comment in
    `db-connection-monitor.ts` notes that a failed ping can mean "a saturated pool
    rather than a lost connection, and destroying the pool would abort every
    pending acquisition", then applies that reasoning only to sqlite and performs
    the destructive recovery on Postgres regardless. Raising this widens the margin

    This also applies to the database monitor's `pool.connect()` call. The
    monitor separately races that call against `DB_PING_TIMEOUT_MS`, so the two
    settings are configured separately but are not runtime-independent. The
    effective health-check acquisition deadline is whichever timeout fires

Both nodes use redis_node_type, so the Redis cost roughly doubles. What this buys is that the QUEUE SURVIVES the node loss, not that n8n rides the failover out: measured on a live cluster, ElastiCache promotes the replica in about 20 seconds and every main, worker and webhook pod exits and restarts during that window (n8n's RedisClientService calls process.exit once Redis has been unreachable for QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD; raising that threshold to 30s was tried and still fell short of this failover, though a larger reconnect budget can ride one out, and wiring that threshold up is the follow-up in PR #77).

Drain workers and pick a maintenance window. Enabling it on a deployment that is ALREADY on a replication group (redis_high_availability_enabled = true) is supported but takes three applies, not one: AWS refuses a direct plaintext-to-encrypted transition and requires the group to pass through transit_encryption_mode = preferred first, and it refuses an AUTH token until the mode is required.

The full sequence was run against a live cluster with a client connection held open across every step and interrupted service at no point; see README for the three steps, their measured durations, and why the third one is not optional. Retrieve the generated token with `terraform output -raw redis_auth_token`. With create_elasticache = false, this instead declares that the external Redis at redis_host speaks TLS: the module does not verify this, so setting it against a plaintext endpoint is a connection failure, not a security hole, and leaving it false against a TLS-only endpoint fails the same way in reverse. The module does not generate a token for a Redis it does not manage; supply one via redis_auth_token if your external Redis requires AUTH. redis_transit_encryption_mode and redis_apply_immediately describe the module-managed migration lever specifically and do not apply on this path.

# ── Pod DNS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

variable "n8n_dns_config" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Pod-level DNS settings applied to the main, worker and webhook-processor pods
    (the chart's top-level `dnsConfig`, rendered into all three pod specs).
    Defaults to null, which omits the block entirely and leaves Kubernetes'
    defaults in place, so this is a no-op unless set.

    THE REASON THIS EXISTS: Kubernetes injects `options ndots:5` plus four search
    domains into every pod. A name with FEWER than 5 dots is tried against every
    search domain BEFORE being tried as written. Every AWS endpoint n8n talks to
    that has 4 dots or fewer therefore costs FIVE DNS queries, four of them
    guaranteed NXDOMAIN. Measured on a 246-pod deployment at roughly 670 req/s:
    12,794 DNS queries/s sustained, peaking at 15,098 (22.5 per HTTP request),
    of which 80.0% were NXDOMAIN, which is exactly the predicted 4-in-5. That
    volume saturated the cluster's two CoreDNS replicas and produced
    `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN` on S3 writes, surfacing to callers as HTTP 500s.

    Which endpoints are affected depends only on their dot count:
      s3.<region>.amazonaws.com bucket endpoints   4 dots  -> amplified 5x
      <svc>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local                 4 dots  -> amplified 5x
      RDS/Aurora writer endpoints                  5 dots  -> not amplified
      ElastiCache endpoints                        6 dots  -> not amplified

    The standard remedy is `ndots: 1`, which makes any name containing at least
    one dot resolve directly and cuts DNS volume roughly 5x. It is safe here
    because this module addresses every in-cluster dependency by FQDN already;
    bare single-label names (0 dots) still use the search path unchanged:

      n8n_dns_config = {
        options = [{ name = "ndots", value = "1" }]
      }

    Setting `ndots` lower than the longest bare name you rely on will break that
    name's resolution, so if you add your own single-label service references,
    either write them as FQDNs or leave this unset.

    Nameservers are validated as plain IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, at most 3,
    matching the limits the Kubernetes pod spec enforces at admission.

    Search domains are validated to Kubernetes' relaxed rules
    (RelaxedDNSSearchValidation, on by default since 1.33 and GA in 1.34):
    lowercase RFC 1123 subdomains of at most 253 characters, underscores
    permitted, and a bare "." accepted. Clusters on 1.32 or older validate
    strictly at admission, unless the RelaxedDNSSearchValidation feature
    gate is enabled by hand, and reject "." and underscore-containing
    domains even though this module's plan accepts them.
