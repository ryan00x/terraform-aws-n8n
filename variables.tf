IMPORTANT: the module-managed ALB serves the webhook path prefixes as well as the editor UI, and this restriction applies to the whole load balancer rather than per path, so it blocks inbound production webhooks from third-party senders (Slack, Stripe, GitHub, Telegram) as surely as it blocks a browser. Use it when nothing external needs to call in, or when every sender is on a known range. To lock down the editor while keeping webhooks public, run two load balancers instead: see examples/split-ingress. This narrows an internet-facing ALB; it is not the same as ingress_scheme = \"internal\", which moves the ALB into private subnets and off public DNS. The restriction applies to every listen port, so port 80 (the HTTPS redirect) is filtered too. IPv4 only, matching the ALB this module builds: it leaves the controller's default ipv4 address type in place, so an IPv6 rule would never match a client. A dualstack ALB needs a VPC and subnets with IPv6 CIDRs, which the module does not create; set the whole allow-list on the annotation through ingress_annotations if you run one. LBC ignores this annotation when alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups is set through ingress_annotations, because the caller then owns the security group. An IngressClassParams setting spec.inboundCIDRs does replace this annotation rather than merging with it, but only for an Ingress the controller classifies through spec.ingressClassName; the module-managed Ingress also carries the legacy kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation, which the controller matches first, so a populated IngressClassParams cannot override this input. See docs/troubleshooting.md, which has the kubectl commands and covers the caller-owned Ingresses that are exposed.

Preferred over alb_inbound_cidrs when the allowed ranges are already maintained as a prefix list, or shared across load balancers and security groups: the list is edited in one place and every reference follows, instead of re-applying this module for a range change. Combines with alb_inbound_cidrs, which is a union rather than an intersection. Mind the security group quota: a rule referencing a prefix list counts against the rules-per-security-group quota (default 60, quota code L-0EA8095F) by the list's max-entries weight rather than as one rule, once per listen port, and this ALB listens on 80 and 443, so everything counts twice. Keep 2 x (combined list weight + number of alb_inbound_cidrs entries) at or under the quota. A list too heavy to fit, and most AWS-managed lists are (the CloudFront origin-facing list weighs 55, needing 110 rules of the default 60 by itself), takes the ALB offline for every source instead of failing the apply: the controller revokes the existing rules first, then RulesPerSecurityGroupLimitExceeded stops it from authorizing the new ones, and the security group is left with no ingress rules at all, webhooks included, while terraform apply reports success.

What this buys is that the QUEUE SURVIVES the node loss, not that n8n rides the failover out: measured on a live cluster, ElastiCache promotes the replica in about 20 seconds and every main, worker and webhook pod exits and restarts during that window (n8n's RedisClientService calls process.exit once Redis has been unreachable for QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD; raising that threshold to 30s was tried and still fell short of this failover, though a larger reconnect budget can ride one out, and wiring that threshold up is the follow-up in PR #77). Recovery is automatic and takes well under a minute, and the queued executions are still there on the promoted node. Compare that with the single-node default, where a lost node means waiting for AWS to build a new one and the queue is gone with it. FLIPPING THIS ON AN EXISTING DEPLOYMENT REPLACES REDIS: the two topologies are different resource types, so no `moved` block can bridge them and Terraform destroys the cluster before creating the replication group. Every queued and in-flight execution in Redis at that moment is lost. See README → \"Redis high availability\" for the drain-first procedure."
