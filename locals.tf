  # Doing the translation here rather than asking callers to write chart YAML
  # through a Terraform variable is what makes the inputs checkable at plan
  # time, and keeping it in a local rather than inline in the values map is
  # what makes it assertable: helm_release.n8n.values is unknown at plan time,
  # since it carries the S3 role ARN and the database endpoint among others.
  #
  # default_mode arrives as an octal string and is converted with parseint,
  # because Kubernetes wants the integer. A Terraform number literal cannot do
  # this job: 0644 parses as decimal 644, which is octal 1204.
