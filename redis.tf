# ── ElastiCache Redis ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# n8n uses Redis as the queue backend for distributing workflow executions
# between worker pods, and for coordinating multi-main instances.
#
# Two mutually exclusive topologies, chosen by redis_high_availability_enabled.
# They are different resource types, so switching between them is a destroy and
# recreate: `moved` cannot bridge resource types, and the queue goes with the
# node. The flip is a maintenance-window operation, not a rolling change. See
# README → "Redis high availability".
#
# Both pin engine 7.1 and listen on 6379, so the only thing the toggle changes
# about the endpoint n8n connects to is its hostname. The single-node cluster
# leaves `port` unset deliberately. It inherits the same 6379 from the engine
# default, and writing it out now would be a gratuitous attribute change on
# every existing deployment for a value that is already what it says.

# Default: one node, no failover. Cheapest, and a single point of failure for
# both the queue and multi-main leader election.

# Opt-in: primary + one replica across two AZs, with ElastiCache promoting the

# automatic_failover_enabled accepts and the cheapest that removes the single
# point of failure; multi_az_enabled is what forces the replica into a second AZ
# rather than leaving both nodes exposed to one AZ event.
#
# What this buys is that the queue survives the node loss, NOT that n8n rides
# the failover out. Measured on a live cluster: promotion took ~20s, the queued
# executions were intact on the promoted node afterwards, and every main, worker
# and webhook pod exited and restarted while it happened. n8n's
# RedisClientService calls process.exit once Redis has been unreachable for
# QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD; raising that to 30s was tried here and
# still fell short of this failover. A larger budget can ride one out, and
# wiring the threshold up is the follow-up in PR #77, so n8n's default is
# left alone here. See README ->

  # replication groups, and rejects a second resource reusing the name:
  #
  #   InvalidParameterValue: Cannot have a cluster and replication group with
  #   same identifier. Please use a different identifier.
  #
  # The two resources are independent, so Terraform is free to create this one
  # while the cluster it replaces still exists. With a shared name the apply
  # that flips the toggle would destroy the old cache and then fail to create
  # the replacement, leaving the deployment with no queue backend at all and
  # needing a second apply to recover. A distinct suffix removes the ordering
  # hazard in both directions, so enabling and disabling are each one apply.
  #
  # This constraint was found the hard way on a live cluster while building the
  # sibling redis_transit_encryption_enabled path (#41), not reasoned about.
  #
  # The suffix is "-redis-rg" (replication group) rather than "-redis-ha", even
  # though high availability is the only thing that selects this resource today.

  # exists only on this resource type. Both toggles therefore converge on this
  # one resource, and a topology-specific name would misdescribe it for a caller
  # who wanted only TLS. Naming it neutrally now is free; renaming it after
  # release is not, because replication_group_id forces replacement and anyone
  # who had already opted in would lose their queue a second time.

# the module to use their Redis gets a module-managed ElastiCache instead, and
# n8n queues onto that. Both exist, the apply succeeds, and the executions land
# somewhere the caller is not watching. A warning rather than an error, because
