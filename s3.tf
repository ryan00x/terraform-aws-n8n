# ── S3 bucket ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# All n8n pods (main, workers, webhook processors) share this bucket for binary
# storage (file attachments, etc.) so every pod reads from the same place. With
# n8n_execution_data_storage_mode = "s3" the same bucket and connection also
# hold execution data (n8n.tf).
#
# No aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration here, deliberately. The two data
# types the bucket can hold need opposite treatment:
#
#   workflows/{wf}/executions/{exec}/binary_data/{fileId}       pruned by S3
#   workflows/{wf}/executions/{exec}/execution_data/bundle.json pruned by n8n
#
# n8n delegates binary-data deletion to S3 (its S3 byte store implements no
# delete-by-prefix), so only a lifecycle rule ever reclaims those objects. n8n
# deletes execution-data bundles itself on the executions hard-delete path, and
# the n8n docs warn that a lifecycle rule can remove bundles it still
# references. A rule cannot be scoped to just one of them either: S3 lifecycle
# filters match a literal key prefix (no wildcards) and both layouts share
# workflows/{wf}/executions/{exec}/, with the distinguishing segment after two
# variable IDs; n8n tags neither object, so a tag filter is out too. Leaving the
# choice to the caller (see the S3 lifecycle section in README.md) is the only
# option that cannot silently delete live data.

# Skipped when create_s3_bucket = false: the caller provides an existing
# bucket (existing_s3_bucket_name) and owns its lifecycle, public-access
# block, and encryption configuration. Only the IAM policy and Pod Identity
# role below are attached to that bucket in that mode.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "n8n" {
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_21:Versioning would defeat n8n's own pruning. n8n prunes execution data in S3 itself (the EXECUTIONS_DATA_* settings, per the n8n docs' external-storage page), and with versioning enabled those deletes only write delete markers, so the bundles persist as noncurrent versions. Nothing here reclaims them: this module ships no lifecycle configuration (header comment above), and the same docs warn against a lifecycle rule over execution data because it can delete objects n8n still references. Enabling versioning by default would silently turn "pruned" execution data into "retained indefinitely", which inverts what an operator setting a retention window asked for. A caller who wants versioning can add aws_s3_bucket_versioning plus a noncurrent-version expiry rule scoped to their own retention policy.
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Server access logging needs a second bucket to receive the logs, which this single-bucket module does not create, and that log bucket would fail this same check unless it logged to a third one. Recording data-plane access to this bucket is CloudTrail S3 data events, an account-level setting outside a workload module's scope.
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_144:Cross-region replication needs a destination bucket in a second region and a second provider alias. This module deploys a single-region stack (one VPC, one EKS cluster, one database), so replicating this bucket alone would not produce anything recoverable elsewhere; multi-region DR is a property of the caller's topology, not of this bucket.
  # checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_61:No lifecycle configuration, by design and for the reasons documented in the header comment above. Leaving object expiry to the caller is the only option that cannot silently delete data n8n still references.
  # checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_62:Event notifications exist to drive downstream consumers, and nothing in this module consumes S3 events; n8n reads and writes the bucket directly through its own S3 client. An aws_s3_bucket_notification here would have no destination to point at.
  # checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_6:This bucket IS fronted by a public-access block, aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.n8n below. Checkov does not always resolve that attachment through a caller module's own `module "n8n" { source = ... }` invocation once this resource carries a `count` tied to create_s3_bucket, the same tooling limitation already documented on aws_security_group.rds in database.tf and on CKV2_AWS_30 there. Verified live: the public-access block exists and is attached whenever create_s3_bucket = true creates this bucket at all.
  # checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_145:This bucket IS encrypted with a Customer Managed KMS Key by default, aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration.n8n below, gated on the same var.create_s3_bucket count and subject to the same nested-module resolution limitation as CKV2_AWS_6 above. s3_kms_encryption_enabled defaults to true precisely to satisfy this check; see that variable and the bucket-encryption section below for the mechanism.

# ── Bucket encryption ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# S3 encrypts every object at rest unconditionally (SSE-S3 with S3-managed
# keys has been the floor for all buckets since January 2023), so this section
# decides *which* key, not whether. A bucket default of SSE-KMS with a
# module-managed CMK matches what the module already does for RDS storage,
# Performance Insights, EKS Secrets and every log group, and it clears
# CKV_AWS_145. Gated behind var.s3_kms_encryption_enabled for callers who would
# rather not add KMS to this path. Set s3_kms_key_arn to use an existing
# Customer Managed Key instead of the CMK this module would otherwise create
# for itself; see local.s3_kms_key_arn (locals.tf).
#
# bucket_key_enabled = true turns on S3 Bucket Keys, which derive a
# bucket-level data key instead of calling KMS once per object. n8n writes one
# object per binary attachment and, with n8n_execution_data_storage_mode =
# "s3", one per execution, so without this the KMS request bill would scale
# with execution volume. Only meaningful under SSE-KMS; AES256 ignores it.
#
# Skipped when create_s3_bucket = false, along with the public-access block
# above: attaching an encryption configuration to a bucket the caller owns is
# the caller's decision, not the module's. s3_kms_key_arn still matters on that

# exactly what a caller pointing n8n at their own SSE-KMS bucket needs. Warning
# on it would now steer people away from the one setting that makes their
# deployment work.
#
# The inverse (an SSE-KMS bucket supplied with no s3_kms_key_arn) is the
# remaining footgun, and it is not checkable: the module would have to read the
# bucket's encryption configuration, which means a data source, an AWS call at
# plan time, and a hard failure for anyone whose credentials cannot read it.
# Documented on the variable and in README.md instead.
#
# For the same reason there is no data.aws_kms_key describing s3_kms_key_arn,
# even though database.tf has exactly that for db_kms_key_arn. The difference is
# who needs the key: creating an encrypted RDS instance requires the caller to
# hold kms:DescribeKey and kms:CreateGrant on the key already, so describing it
# at plan time asks for nothing new. Here the key is only ever a string the
# module writes into an IAM policy and, on the create_s3_bucket = true path, into
# a bucket encryption configuration. Nothing in that requires the Terraform
# caller to have any permission on the key at all: the principal that needs
# kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey is the n8n pod role, at runtime. Adding a
# plan-time describe would invent an IAM requirement the apply does not have.
#
# What is checkable without an API call is the region, below.

# KMS keys are regional, and S3 rejects a bucket encryption configuration naming
# a key from another region. On the create_s3_bucket = false path nothing fails
# at apply time at all: the IAM policy is written happily, and every object read
# and write then fails with AccessDenied at runtime, which is the worst place to
# discover it. Asserted from the ARN string, so it costs nothing and holds on
# both paths. Account is deliberately not asserted: a CMK shared from a central
# security account is a legitimate setup, and cross-account SSE-KMS works as long
# as the key policy allows the pod role.

# The "X is ignored when Y" half of create_s3_kms_key's contract, matching
# database.tf's db_kms_key_arn check. With the module creating its own bucket
# and its own CMK, local.s3_kms_key_arn (locals.tf) resolves to that CMK and
# this input is read nowhere at all, so a caller who set it and expected their
# key to be used gets told rather than left to find out from the bucket's
# encryption configuration. Warn rather than fail: staging the ARN in tfvars
# ahead of flipping create_s3_kms_key is a legitimate thing to do, and on the
# create_s3_bucket = false path the ARN is meaningful on its own (it is what
# grants the pod role kms:Decrypt on your bucket's key), so this deliberately
# does not fire there.
